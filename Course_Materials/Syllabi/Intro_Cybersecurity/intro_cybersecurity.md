## Course Policies

### Attendance and Participation

Active engagement in programming courses is crucial for skill development. This course follows a hands-on, workshop-style approach where each class builds on previous knowledge.

**Attendance Requirements:**
- Students should attend all lecture and lab sessions
- More than 3 unexcused absences may impact your participation grade
- Students arriving more than 15 minutes late will be counted as absent
- Lab sessions cannot be made up without prior arrangement

**Participation Expectations:**
- Come prepared having completed assigned readings
- Actively engage in coding exercises and discussions
- Contribute to peer code reviews and debugging sessions
- Maintain a professional and supportive classroom environment
- Document your programming process through comments and development logs

### Late Work and Extensions

Programming projects require time management and regular progress. Our late work policy aims to be fair while encouraging timely completion:

**Standard Late Policy:**
- Assignments submitted up to 48 hours late: 10% penalty
- Assignments submitted 48-96 hours late: 25% penalty
- No assignments accepted after 96 hours without an approved extension
- Lowest lab grade will be dropped to account for unexpected circumstances

**Extension Requests:**
- Must be submitted at least 48 hours before the due date
- Require documentation of extenuating circumstances
- Limited to two extensions per semester
- Cannot be used for the final project or exit exam

### Academic Integrity

Programming is a collaborative field, but individual learning is crucial for skill development. This course has specific guidelines for collaboration and tool use:

**Code Collaboration Guidelines:**
- Discussion of concepts and approaches is encouraged
- Sharing actual code is prohibited unless explicitly allowed
- Debugging help should focus on process, not direct solutions
- All collaborative discussions must be documented in code comments

**Generative AI Policy:**

*Weeks 1-10 (Fundamental Skill Building):*
- Use of generative AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) is prohibited
- Focus on developing core programming skills independently
- Learning to think algorithmically and debug systematically
- Violations will result in zero credit for the assignment for the first offense and failure of the course and referral to the Office of the Dean of Students for adjudication on subsequent offenses.

*Weeks 11-16 (Advanced Development):*
- Limited use of generative AI tools permitted with specific requirements:
  1. Complete AI conversation logs must be submitted with assignments
  2. 2-3 page reflection paper analyzing:
     - How AI assisted your development process
     - What you learned by using AI
     - What you might have missed by using AI
     - How you verified and tested AI-generated code
     - Impact on your problem-solving skills
  3. Clear documentation of which parts of code were AI-generated
  4. Explanation of any modifications made to AI-generated code

**Attribution Requirements:**
- All code sources must be cited (textbook, online resources, AI tools)
- Include URLs and access dates for online resources
- Document any help received from classmates or tutors
- Maintain a development log noting all external assistance

**Consequences of Violations:**
- First offense: Zero on the assignment and required meeting with instructor
- Second offense: Failing grade in the course
- All violations reported to Dean of Academic Affairs
- Undisclosed use of AI tools treated as academic dishonesty

**Learning Support vs. Academic Dishonesty:**
We recognize the difference between:
- Seeking help to understand concepts (encouraged)
- Having others solve problems for you (prohibited)
- Using AI to learn (permitted with documentation in later weeks)
- Using AI to learn *for you* (prohibited)

This policy aims to:
1. Ensure fundamental programming skills are developed
2. Teach responsible and effective use of AI tools (read: critical AI literacy)
3. Maintain academic integrity
4. Prepare students for real-world development environments
