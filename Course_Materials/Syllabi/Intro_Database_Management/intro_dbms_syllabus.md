- Understand relational database design principles
- Identify appropriate data types for various applications

### Data Modeling
- Design Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams
- Convert ER diagrams into relational schemas
- Apply normalization principles to improve database efficiency and integrity

### SQL Programming
- Write SQL statements for data definition (DDL) and manipulation (DML)
- Execute complex queries using joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions
- Implement transactions and handle data integrity

### Database Administration
- Create and manage database users and permissions
- Understand basic security concepts and practices
- Perform simple database backup and restore operations
