# Changelog

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- Split into **two separate 15-week courses**:
  - **CMIS 2XX: Introduction to Securing AI (SecAI I)**
  - **CMIS 2XY: Advanced Securing AI (SecAI II)**
- Expanded course outlines and assignment schedules for both I and II to cover full 15-week terms.

### Changed
- **Core Learning Outcomes (CLOs):**
  - Polished verbs for Bloom’s alignment:
    - SecAI I emphasizes *describe, identify, analyze, apply*.
    - SecAI II emphasizes *design, implement, evaluate, produce*.
- **Workload hours:** 
  - Scaled out-of-class work to ~120 hours per course (COMAR/FCC standard).
  - Added lab reflection journals (SecAI I) and peer feedback activities (SecAI II).
- **Assessment weighting:**
  - Normalized both courses to **1,000 total points**.
  - Adjusted point distributions:
    - SecAI I: stronger weighting for practicum and threat modeling project.
    - SecAI II: heavier weighting for capstone project and compliance mapping.
- **Participation policies:**
  - SecAI I: emphasized engagement in labs, discussions, and weekly reflections.
  - SecAI II: added explicit requirements for **capstone participation and peer feedback**.

### Fixed
- Weekly structure updated from **Mon–Sun → Sat–Fri** to align with FCC academic calendar.
- Labs moved to **Wednesday** in schedules to give students more time for write-ups before end-of-week deadlines.

### Notes
- Once CompTIA releases official **SecAI+ exam domains**, CLOs and assessment mapping should be updated to explicitly align with those domains.
- Gen Ed/program applicability notes to be reviewed for catalog submission.
