## Development Timeline
Active work on this portfolio began in December 2023 and continued through October 2025. Development started from the *Intro to Programming* courses and concluded with the AI Literacy and AI Security courses. During this time, I changed careers from a teaching professor at a private 4-year university to a school-level administrator at a public 2-year college.
