# Project 2: SQL Querying – Analytic Grading Rubric

Use this rubric to assess student performance on **Project 2** (SQL Querying). Each **criterion** below can be scored independently. The final grade is the **sum** of all criteria.

| Criterion                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Excellent (A)                                                                                                                                                                                   | Good (B)                                                                                                                                                                      | Fair (C)                                                                                                                                                           | Poor (D/F)                                                                                                                                    | Weight |

| **1. Completeness**      | Measures how thoroughly the student addresses all required query types (SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY, subqueries, etc.), plus any optional challenges.                                                                                                                                                            | **23–25 pts** <br>All specified queries (and optional tasks, if pursued) are present, demonstrating comprehensive coverage of required topics.                                                  | **20–22 pts** <br>All major queries are completed; may omit a minor portion or optional task.                                                                     | **17–19 pts** <br>Some required queries are missing or incomplete; coverage of topics is uneven.                                                                  | **0–16 pts** <br>Many required queries are missing or incomplete; student shows limited evidence of having addressed the assignment requirements.                 | 25%   |
| **2. Accuracy**          | Assesses whether queries execute without errors and produce logically correct results (e.g., correct joins, correct counts/aggregations).                                                                                                                                                                    | **23–25 pts** <br>All queries run smoothly; results are factually correct and align with the scenario. No syntax or logical errors.                                                              | **20–22 pts** <br>Queries mostly run correctly; a few minor errors or edge cases might be incorrect, but overall logic is sound.                                                    | **17–19 pts** <br>Some queries fail to run (syntax errors) or produce incorrect results; logic needs refinement.                                                    | **0–16 pts** <br>Queries consistently fail or produce clearly incorrect/irrelevant outputs; major syntax/logic errors are present.                                 | 25%   |
| **3. Readability & Clarity** | Examines how well the SQL code is formatted, documented, and organized for readability. Also includes clarity of any brief explanations or comment lines that illustrate the student’s approach.                                                                                                         | **23–25 pts** <br>SQL statements are neatly formatted and well-commented (where needed). It’s very easy to read and understand the student’s approach.                                           | **20–22 pts** <br>Code is generally well-structured, though some formatting or commentary could be improved.                                                                     | **17–19 pts** <br>SQL code runs, but minimal formatting or explanation is present, making it harder to follow.                                                    | **0–16 pts** <br>Disorganized code and little-to-no explanation; difficult to interpret the student’s intentions or approach.                                    | 25%   |
| **4. Depth & Insight**   | Evaluates whether the student demonstrates deeper insight—using more advanced SQL constructs (subqueries, multiple JOINs, clever filtering, etc.)—and whether they go beyond minimal requirements (e.g., attempt the optional tasks, add interesting queries or angles). Also covers the thoroughness of any narrative explanations. | **23–25 pts** <br>Consistently demonstrates advanced SQL features or creative problem-solving. Optional tasks (if any) are pursued with thorough or innovative queries; explanations provide insight. | **20–22 pts** <br>Occasional use of advanced features; optional tasks may be partially addressed. Shows good reasoning and some depth in explanations.                         | **17–19 pts** <br>Queries rely mostly on basic statements without exploring advanced constructs; explanations are minimal or superficial.                          | **0–16 pts** <br>Minimal or no attempt to engage deeper SQL techniques; the submission lacks insight or exploration beyond the most basic requirements.            | 25%   |

## Interpreting the Score
- **A (90–100%)**: Demonstrates full mastery of required SQL concepts, with strong accuracy and completeness. Code is well-structured and shows depth of analysis or creativity.  
- **B (80–89%)**: Covers most requirements accurately, with minor improvements needed in completeness, correctness, or clarity.  
- **C (70–79%)**: Some gaps in meeting requirements or accuracy; queries might have structural issues or missing elements.  
- **D/F (<70%)**: Significant problems with completeness, correctness, or clarity; student has not demonstrated adequate SQL proficiency.
