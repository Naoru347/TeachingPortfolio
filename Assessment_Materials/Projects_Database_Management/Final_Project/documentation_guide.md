# Final Project Documentation Guide

Use this guide to structure your documentation for the final project. Your documentation should clearly explain **what you built**, **how it works**, and **why** you made certain design choices. A well-organized and concise document will help your instructor (and any future stakeholders) understand your database project at a glance.

---

## 1. Introduction

1. **Project Overview**  
   - State the **scenario** you chose (Medical Clinic, Online Marketplace, or Student Information System).  
   - Briefly explain the **purpose** of the system: “This database tracks ...” or “The goal is to manage ...”  

2. **Scope & Goals**  
   - Outline the **main objectives** (e.g., handle patient appointments, process orders, track grades).  
   - If you have specific **success criteria** (e.g., “No double-bookings,” “Automatic inventory restocking triggers”), mention them here.

---

## 2. System Requirements & Assumptions

1. **Key Requirements**  
   - Reference any specific **business rules** or constraints from the assignment prompt (e.g., “Unique patient IDs,” “Credit card orders must have valid payment info,” “A student cannot enroll in overlapping classes without permission,” etc.).  

2. **Assumptions**  
   - Note any **assumptions** you made that are **not** explicitly stated in the prompt. Examples:  
     - “Each student has exactly one major.”  
     - “Doctors can only see one patient at any time slot.”  
     - “We allow negative stock for backordered items.”  

3. **Scope Limitations (Optional)**  
   - Clarify if there are **any features** you intentionally excluded (e.g., no advanced scheduling, no discount codes, etc.).

---

## 3. Database Design

1. **Conceptual ER Diagram**  
   - Include an **image** or **PDF** of your **Entity-Relationship Diagram**.  
   - Make sure it’s labeled clearly (entities, attributes, relationships).  
   - If you used **Chen’s** or **Crow’s Foot** notation, specify which.

2. **Relational Schema**  
   - Translate your ER diagram into a **relational schema**.  
   - List each **table** with its **columns**, **data types**, and **primary/foreign keys**.  
   - Clearly identify relationships (e.g., `orders` table references `customers(customer_id)`).

3. **Normalization** (Optional or Brief)  
   - Indicate the **normal forms** you targeted (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).  
   - Mention any **denormalization** decisions and why (performance, simpler queries, etc.).

---

## 4. Implementation Details

1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**  
   - Summarize how you **created** each table (or refer to your `create_final_project.sql` file).  
   - Highlight any **special constraints** (CHECK constraints, UNIQUE, NOT NULL).  
   - If you used **indexes**, explain which columns and why.

2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**  
   - Briefly describe how you **inserted sample data** (or refer to your `insert_final_project_data.sql` file).  
   - Provide any interesting or notable examples of data (e.g., “We added 10 different patient records with varying appointment needs,” “We inserted test products with different stock levels”).

3. **Stored Procedures / Triggers** (If Implemented)  
   - Describe the **logic** behind any stored procedures or triggers.  
   - Explain **how** and **when** they get triggered, and **why** you created them (prevent double-booking, auto-calculate totals, etc.).  
   - Provide sample **use cases** or examples of them in action.

---

## 5. Demonstration of Key Queries

1. **Core Queries**  
   - List and briefly **explain** the queries that demonstrate system functionality (e.g., “Top 5 best-selling products,” “All upcoming appointments for next week,” “Average GPA by course”).  
   - Show the **SQL** or reference a separate `.sql` file (e.g., `queries_final_project.sql`).  

2. **Sample Output** (Optional)  
   - Include **screenshots** or **result snippets** (limited rows) to illustrate the outcome of key queries.  
   - Clarify how these results confirm your system is working properly.

3. **Advanced or Special Queries**  
   - If you used subqueries, window functions, or advanced analytics, highlight them (e.g., “We used a subquery to find the top 1% of students by GPA,” “We used a window function to rank products by sales”).

---

## 6. User Instructions

1. **Setup Steps**  
   - Instructions for **cloning** or **downloading** your project files.  
   - Database version requirements (e.g., “Tested on MySQL 8.0,” “Compatible with PostgreSQL 14”).  
   - Any environment specifics (e.g., Docker, local machine, hosting).

2. **Running the Scripts**  
   - Step-by-step on how to **create** the database and **insert** sample data (e.g., “Run `create_final_project.sql`, then `insert_final_project_data.sql`).  
   - Mention any **dependencies** or special config steps.  

3. **Testing**  
   - Show how to run or test your queries (e.g., “Open `queries_final_project.sql` in your SQL client”).  
   - Indicate how to verify triggers or stored procedures (e.g., “Insert a new record into the `appointments` table to see the `double_booking_trigger` in action”).

---

## 7. Challenges & Reflections (Optional)

- Describe any **difficulties** you faced (e.g., deciding on data types, designing triggers) and how you **resolved** them.  
- Note any potential **future improvements** or **extensions** (e.g., building a full front-end, adding a recommendation engine).

---

## 8. Conclusion

- Give a brief **summary** of your project’s accomplishments.  
- Restate the **core features** and **value** of your database solution.  
- Mention anything else you feel is important for understanding or evaluating your work.

---

## Appendix (Optional)

- **Extra Screenshots** or references (ERD, UML diagrams).  
- **Change Log** if you iterated multiple times.

---

### Final Tips

- **Be Concise, Yet Detailed**: Include enough detail for someone else to replicate or validate your work, but avoid unnecessary text.  
- **Use Headings & Subheadings**: As shown above, headings keep your document organized.  
- **Check for Consistency**: Make sure table names, column names, and details match across your ER diagram, SQL scripts, and documentation.  
- **Proofread**: Spelling and clarity matter – a neat, well-structured doc shows professionalism.

**Good luck documenting your final project!** This documentation is your chance to showcase the depth and breadth of your understanding, making it easier for the instructor (or any collaborator) to follow your work.
