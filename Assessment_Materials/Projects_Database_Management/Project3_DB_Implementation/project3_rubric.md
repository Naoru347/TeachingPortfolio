# Personal Finance Tracker – Grading Rubric

Use this rubric to evaluate each student’s **Personal Finance Tracker** project, which encompasses database design, data handling, query logic, and documentation. The total possible score is **100%**, distributed across five criteria.

| **Criterion**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Excellent (A)**                                                                                                                                                 | **Good (B)**                                                                                                                                                     | **Fair (C)**                                                                                                                                            | **Poor (D/F)**                                                                                                                                        | **Weight** |

| **1. Database Schema & Completeness** | How well does the schema address all **required tables** (accounts, transactions, recurring bills, etc.) and relationships? Are **constraints** (PK, FK) properly defined? Does the student include optional features (e.g., budget, categories)? | **23–25 pts**<br>- All required entities are present and fully implemented.<br>- PK/FK constraints and relationships are correctly defined.<br>- Advanced/optional features are well integrated.         | **20–22 pts**<br>- Most required entities and relationships are included with correct constraints.<br>- May have minor issues or missing optional elements.                                              | **17–19 pts**<br>- Some tables or relationships missing or incomplete.<br>- Constraints may be unclear or inconsistently applied.<br>- Basic coverage of requirements.                      | **0–16 pts**<br>- Many core tables/relationships missing or incorrectly implemented.<br>- Lack of constraints or severe schema flaws hamper functionality.                                   | **25%**    |
| **2. Data Insertion & Handling**     | Did the student populate the database with **ample** and **varied** sample data? Do data constraints work (e.g., preventing negative balances if designed)? Is the data realistic and consistent with the financial context?              | **23–25 pts**<br>- Substantial, realistic data demonstrating different account types, transactions, and recurring items.<br>- Constraints effectively maintain data integrity (e.g., no invalid entries). | **20–22 pts**<br>- Adequate sample data covering key use cases.<br>- Some minor inconsistencies or underutilized constraints, but data is largely appropriate.                                          | **17–19 pts**<br>- Minimal sample data or not enough variation to demonstrate system functionality.<br>- Constraints not fully tested or partially implemented.                              | **0–16 pts**<br>- Insufficient or trivial data.<br>- Major inconsistencies in data or constraints not applied, resulting in unrealistic/unusable dataset.                                    | **25%**    |
| **3. Queries & Logic Implementation** | Does the submission include relevant **SQL queries** (e.g., monthly summaries, largest expenses)? Are **stored procedures/triggers** (if implemented) functioning correctly and logically?                                              | **23–25 pts**<br>- Wide range of queries showcasing advanced operations (aggregations, joins).<br>- Stored procedures/triggers (if used) enhance functionality and run without errors.                   | **20–22 pts**<br>- Essential queries present (e.g., account balances, expenses).<br>- Some advanced features or triggers are partially implemented or have minor issues.                                  | **17–19 pts**<br>- Only basic queries demonstrated or errors in more advanced logic.<br>- Limited or no use of triggers/stored procedures.                                                   | **0–16 pts**<br>- Queries are mostly incorrect, incomplete, or produce errors.<br>- No evidence of advanced logic or working triggers/procedures.                                            | **25%**    |
| **4. Documentation & Explanation**   | Is there a **clear write-up** explaining the schema design, assumptions, and any specialized logic?

| **5. Clarity & Creativity**          | Is the project **well-structured** (logical table names, consistent naming conventions)? Does it demonstrate **innovative** or **extra** features beyond the basic requirements (e.g., advanced budgeting, specialized triggers)?             | **9–10 pts**<br>- Clean, organized schema and code with consistent conventions.<br>- Demonstrates creativity or unique additions (e.g., advanced budget tracking, robust triggers).                     | **8 pts**<br>- Generally coherent and readable.<br>- May include some minor extras or unique features, but overall is straightforward in scope.                                                        | **7 pts**<br>- Project is functional but disorganized or difficult to follow.<br>- No significant enhancements or creative elements.                                                        | **0–6 pts**<br>- Overall structure is confusing with poor naming conventions.<br>- Lacks any attempt at creativity or additional features.                                                  | **10%**    |

## Score Interpretation

- **A (90–100%)**  
  Comprehensive and highly polished database implementation that meets or exceeds all requirements. Demonstrates robust, accurate data handling and creative problem-solving.

- **B (80–89%)**  
  Solid work covering nearly all expectations with only minor lapses in thoroughness, accuracy, or documentation.

- **C (70–79%)**  
  Adequate coverage of the project requirements but with noticeable flaws in completeness, data handling, or clarity.

- **D/F (<70%)**  
  Significant deficiencies across multiple criteria. Major issues prevent the database from functioning as intended or show limited effort.
