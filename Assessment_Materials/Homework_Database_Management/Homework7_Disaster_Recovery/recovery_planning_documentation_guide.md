# Disaster Recovery Planning & Documentation Guide

## Overview
Disaster Recovery (DR) plans are essential for ensuring a quick and efficient response when catastrophic events—like hardware failures, data corruption, or natural disasters—disrupt your database systems. This guide walks you through the key considerations and steps to create a robust DR plan, specifically for DBA operations.

## 1. Define Your Objectives

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- **What it is:** The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.  
- **How to set it:** Determine how frequently backups should occur and how much data your organization can afford to lose (e.g., 15 minutes, 1 hour, 24 hours).

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- **What it is:** The maximum acceptable downtime for the database after a disaster.  
- **How to set it:** Decide how quickly services must be restored. Consider business needs, user impact, and budget constraints.

> **Tip:** Balancing RPO and RTO typically involves trade-offs in cost and complexity—faster recovery often requires more advanced (and expensive) strategies.

## 2. Identify Risks & Scenarios
List potential disasters and categorize them by likelihood and severity:
- **Hardware Failures:** Disk crashes, server malfunctions, power supply issues.
- **Software/Logical Failures:** Data corruption, malicious scripts, user errors.
- **Natural Disasters:** Floods, earthquakes, fires.
- **Security Breaches:** Ransomware attacks, unauthorized data access.

**Example Format:**

| Risk               | Likelihood | Impact  | Mitigation                          |
|--------------------|-----------|---------|-------------------------------------|
| Disk Failure       | High       | Medium  | RAID arrays, regular backups        |
| Power Outage       | Medium     | Medium  | UPS, generator                      |
| Ransomware Attack  | Low        | High    | Strong security, offline backups    |
| Earthquake         | Low        | High    | Offsite replication, geo-redundancy |

## 3. Plan Backup & Replication Strategies

1. **Backup Frequency & Types**
   - **Full Backup:** Captures the entire database. Typically scheduled daily, weekly, or monthly.
   - **Incremental Backup:** Backs up only changes since the last backup.
   - **Differential Backup:** Backs up changes since the last full backup.
   - **Transaction Log Backups (if supported):** Capture log entries for point-in-time recovery.

2. **Storage & Retention**
   - **Onsite vs. Offsite Storage:** Keep backups in multiple locations to reduce risk.
   - **Retention Policies:** Decide how many backup sets to keep (e.g., 14 days, 90 days, 1 year).
   - **Media:** Magnetic tape, cloud storage, local SAN/NAS.

3. **Replication/High Availability**
   - **Standby Databases:** Keep a ready-to-go copy in another data center.
   - **Failover Clusters:** Automatic detection and switching in case of primary server failure.
   - **Log Shipping or Mirroring:** Continual updates to a secondary server.

## 4. Outline the Recovery Procedures

### Step-by-Step Restoration
1. **Verify the Disaster:** Confirm the nature of the failure.
2. **Stop Further Damage:** Power down failing hardware, isolate compromised systems.
3. **Locate Appropriate Backups:** Determine which backup set is valid based on your RPO (full, differential, logs).
4. **Restore the Database:**
   - **Full Restore:** Load the most recent full backup.
   - **Incremental or Log Restores:** Reapply changes to minimize data loss.
5. **Validation & Integrity Checks:** Confirm the database is operational and consistent (e.g., run DBCC checks, query tests).
6. **Bring Services Online:** Gradually allow user connections or application traffic.

### Communication Flow
- **Notify Stakeholders:** Alert IT, management, and relevant business units of the ongoing recovery.
- **Provide Status Updates:** Keep teams informed about the estimated time to resolution.
- **Post-Recovery Review:** Document lessons learned and potential improvements.

## 5. Document Roles & Responsibilities

**Who does what during a disaster?**
- **Database Administrator:** Leads the technical restoration, coordinates backups and scripts.
- **System Administrator:** Manages servers, network configuration, hardware replacements.
- **Security Officer:** Ensures no ongoing threat, handles breach investigations.
- **Management:** Makes decisions on cost, scope, and prioritization.

---

## 6. Test & Review the Plan Regularly

1. **Scheduled Drills:** Perform planned recovery drills annually or biannually to ensure everyone knows their role.
2. **Unscheduled Tests:** Random mini-tests (e.g., partial table restore) to confirm backup validity.
3. **Evaluate Results:** Document issues found, refine instructions, and incorporate improvements.
4. **Update the Plan:** Adjust procedures for new systems, updated software, or policy changes.

> **Tip:** Testing is the only way to gain confidence in your plan. If your backups or replication setups fail during testing, it’s cheaper and less stressful than failing in a real disaster.

---

## 7. Post-Recovery Analysis & Improvement

- **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify what caused the disaster, how to mitigate it in the future.
- **Documentation:** Update the DR plan with any new procedures or observations.
- **Security Enhancements:** If the disaster was security-related, strengthen firewalls, intrusion detection, or user access controls.

**1. Introduction**  
- Purpose, Scope, Key Stakeholders.

**2. Systems & Inventory**  
- List all database servers, version details, criticality.

**3. Risk Assessment**  
- Table of potential hazards, mitigations.

**4. Backup Strategy**  
- Frequency, retention, location, media.

**5. Recovery Procedures**  
- Step-by-step guide for each scenario (hardware, logical corruption, etc.).

**6. Communication Plan**  
- Stakeholder contacts, escalation paths.

**7. Testing & Maintenance**

## Final Thoughts

A comprehensive **Disaster Recovery Plan** is a living document. Keeping it current with regular testing and updates ensures that, when a real disaster strikes, your DBA team can respond effectively. By balancing **Recovery Point Objectives** (RPO) and **Recovery Time Objectives** (RTO) with budget and resource constraints, you’ll protect your organization’s data assets and maintain operational continuity under challenging circumstances.
