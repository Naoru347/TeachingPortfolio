=================
Date: 2023-12-12
Graph:
- Nodes: A, B, C, D, E
- Edges:
  - A -> B (Weight: 2)
  - A -> C (Weight: 4)
  - B -> C (Weight: 1)
  - B -> D (Weight: 7)
  - C -> E (Weight: 3)
  - D -> E (Weight: 1)

Traversal Details:
------------------
Start Node: A

Step 1:
- Current Node: A
- Queue: []
- Visited: A
- Neighbors Added to Queue: B, C

Step 2:
- Current Node: B
- Queue: C
- Visited: A, B
- Neighbors Added to Queue: D

Step 3:
- Current Node: C
- Queue: D
- Visited: A, B, C
- Neighbors Added to Queue: E

Step 4:
- Current Node: D
- Queue: E
- Visited: A, B, C, D
- Neighbors Added to Queue: None

Step 5:
- Current Node: E
- Queue: []
- Visited: A, B, C, D, E
- Neighbors Added to Queue: None

Final Order of Nodes Visited:
A -> B -> C -> D -> E

Summary:
--------
- Total Nodes Visited: 5
- Total Edges Traversed: 5
- Path Coverage: Complete traversal of all connected nodes starting from A.
