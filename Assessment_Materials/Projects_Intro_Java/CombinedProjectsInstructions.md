# Shorter Projects Instructions (Java Version)

All projects will be submitted via your GitHub Classroom repository. Follow the submission guidelines for each project, and ensure your repository is organized and includes meaningful commit messages. Below are the instructions for the five shorter projects in this course.

---

## **Project 1: Calculator Application**
**Due:** Week 3  
**Topics Covered:** Variables, Data Types, and Basic Operations  

### **Objective:**
Create a simple calculator program in Java that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

### **Requirements:**
1. **Input and Output:**
   - Accept two numbers and an operation (e.g., +, -, *, /) from the user.
   - Display the result of the calculation.

2. **Features:**
   - Handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., division by zero or non-numeric inputs).
   - Allow the user to perform multiple calculations in a single session.

3. **Enhancements (Optional):**
   - Add additional operations like modulus or exponentiation.
   - Include a menu to let users choose operations interactively.

### **Submission:**
Submit to GitHub with:
- **Code:** Java source file(s) with clear comments.
- **Commit Messages:** Descriptive messages for each change made.

## **Project 2: Pattern Generation**
**Due:** Week 5  
**Topics Covered:** Control Flow (Loops)  

### **Objective:**
Develop a Java program that generates a variety of patterns based on user input.

### **Requirements:**
1. **Patterns:**
   - Implement at least three different patterns (e.g., pyramids, diamonds, or grids).
   - Allow users to choose the pattern type and size.

2. **Loops:**
   - Use nested loops to construct patterns.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Ensure valid inputs (e.g., numeric input for size).

### **Enhancements (Optional):**
   - Use Unicode characters or colors in terminal (if supported).
   - Save pattern output to a file.

### **Submission:**
Submit to GitHub with:
- **Code:** Java file with meaningful comments.
- **README:** Description of patterns implemented.
- **Commit Messages:** Document changes incrementally.

## **Project 3: Temperature Converter Library**
**Due:** Week 7  
**Topics Covered:** Methods, Modular Design  

### **Objective:**
Build a Java application to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

### **Requirements:**
1. **Methods:**
   - Create static methods for each type of conversion.

2. **User Interaction:**
   - Use a menu-based interface.

3. **Modularity:**
   - Organize code into logical sections and separate classes if appropriate.

### **Enhancements (Optional):**
   - Allow batch conversions using arrays or lists.
   - Add unit tests using JUnit.

### **Submission:**
Submit to GitHub with:
- **Code:** Java source file(s).
- **README:** Usage instructions for the converter.
- **Commit Messages:** Track progress with detailed commits.

## **Project 4: Data Processing Application**
**Due:** Week 12  
**Topics Covered:** File I/O, Debugging  

### **Objective:**
Create a Java application to read, process, and summarize data from a file.

### **Requirements:**
1. **File I/O:**
   - Read data from a `.txt` or `.csv` file.
   - Let the user specify the file path.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Sort, filter, or aggregate the data.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle missing files, malformed data, and incorrect formats.

### **Enhancements (Optional):**
   - Write processed data to a new file.
   - Display summary statistics (mean, count, etc.).

### **Submission:**
Submit to GitHub with:
- **Code:** Java file and sample data file.
- **README:** Setup and usage instructions.
- **Commit Messages:** Describe all key updates.

## **Project 5: Simple Class Implementation**
**Due:** Week 14  
**Topics Covered:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  

### **Objective:**
Create a Java program using classes to represent and manipulate real-world objects.

### **Requirements:**
1. **Class Definition:**
   - Define a class with attributes (e.g., `name`, `price`, `quantity`).
   - Implement methods such as `sell()`, `restock()`.

2. **Object Usage:**
   - Instantiate objects and demonstrate their behavior via method calls.

3. **File Integration:**
   - Save and load object data using file I/O.

### **Enhancements (Optional):**
   - Add inheritance (e.g., subclass for special item types).
   - Add validation for fields (e.g., prevent negative quantities).

### **Submission:**
Submit to GitHub with:
- **Code:** Java source files.
- **README:** Explanation of class structure and program use.
- **Commit Messages:** Incremental and descriptive.
