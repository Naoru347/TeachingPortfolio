# Unified Rubric for Shorter Java Projects

This rubric will be used to assess any of the five shorter Java projects. Each project will be graded based on four main categories, with a focus on functionality, code quality, documentation, and professionalism.

## **Grading Criteria**

### **1. Core Functionality (40%)**
- **4 (Excellent):**
  - The program meets all specified requirements.
  - All core functionality is fully implemented and works as intended.
  - Program handles edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully.
- **3 (Good):**
  - The program meets most requirements, with minor issues.
  - Core functionality is implemented but may contain some bugs.
  - Limited handling of edge cases or invalid inputs.
- **2 (Satisfactory):**
  - The program meets some requirements but is incomplete.
  - Core functionality has significant bugs or gaps.
  - Little or no handling of edge cases or invalid inputs.
- **1 (Needs Improvement):**
  - The program meets few or none of the requirements.
  - Core functionality is mostly missing or non-functional.

### **2. Code Quality (30%)**
- **4 (Excellent):**
  - Code is clean, well-organized, and follows Java best practices.
  - Meaningful variable names and comments are used throughout.
  - Proper use of classes, methods, and encapsulation.
- **3 (Good):**
  - Code is mostly clean and organized, with minor issues.
  - Some variable names or comments could be improved.
  - Classes and methods are used, but structure could be more modular.
- **2 (Satisfactory):**
  - Code is functional but lacks structure or clarity.
  - Inconsistent use of meaningful variable names or comments.
  - Poor organization of methods or use of object-oriented principles.
- **1 (Needs Improvement):**
  - Code is difficult to read and poorly organized.
  - No meaningful comments or variable names.
  - Little or no use of classes and modular design.

### **3. Documentation (20%)**
- **4 (Excellent):**
  - README file is comprehensive and professional.
  - Includes a clear project description, instructions for compiling and running the program, and details about features implemented.
  - Code comments effectively explain logic and purpose.
- **3 (Good):**
  - README file is complete but could be more detailed.
  - Instructions are mostly clear, but minor improvements are needed.
  - Code comments are present but could explain more complex logic.
- **2 (Satisfactory):**
  - README file is incomplete or unclear.
  - Instructions for running the program are missing or confusing.
  - Minimal or ineffective use of code comments.
- **1 (Needs Improvement):**
  - README file is missing or severely lacking.
  - No instructions for compiling or running the program.
  - Code comments are absent or unhelpful.

### **4. Professionalism and Workflow (10%)**
- **4 (Excellent):**
  - Program is submitted on time, with a well-organized GitHub repository.
  - Frequent and meaningful Git commits demonstrate progress and iterative development.
  - Repository is free from unnecessary or extraneous files.
- **3 (Good):**
  - Program is submitted on time, but repository structure could be improved.
  - Git commits are somewhat frequent, but commit messages could be clearer.
  - Some unnecessary files are included in the repository.
- **2 (Satisfactory):**
  - Program is late or repository is poorly organized.
  - Few Git commits, or commit messages are unclear or missing.
  - Many unnecessary files are present in the repository.
- **1 (Needs Improvement):**
  - Program is late and repository is disorganized.
  - Minimal or no Git usage.
  - Repository contains excessive unnecessary files.
