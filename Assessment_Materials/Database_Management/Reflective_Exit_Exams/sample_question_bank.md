## Database Fundamentals

### Concepts and Terminology
- Explain what a relational database is and how it differs from other types of databases.
- What is the purpose of keys in a relational database, and what types of keys exist?

### Data Types
- How do you decide which data type to use for a particular field in a database table?
- What issues can arise from choosing inappropriate data types?

## Data Modeling and Design

### Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
- Explain what an Entity-Relationship Diagram is and its role in database design.
- How do you identify entities, attributes, and relationships in a given scenario?

### Normalization
- What is normalization, and why is it important in database design?
- Describe the differences between 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

## SQL Programming

### Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Explain the differences between `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP` statements.
- Give an example of creating a simple table using SQL.

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- What is the difference between `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements?
- Describe a situation where you would use a subquery in SQL.

### SQL Queries
- Explain the difference between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`.
- Provide an example scenario where you would need to use aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, or `AVG()`.

## Database Administration and Security

### Users and Permissions
- How do you manage user permissions in a database, and why is this important?
- What are some common practices for maintaining database security?

### Backup and Recovery
- Explain why regular database backups are crucial.
- Describe basic steps for recovering a database from a backup after a failure.

## Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving

### Performance and Optimization
- What factors can affect database query performance?
- How would you approach troubleshooting a slow-running SQL query?

### Database Design Critique
- Identify potential issues in a provided database schema and suggest improvements.
- Explain how improper design decisions can negatively impact database performance and integrity.

## Real-World Applications

### Application Integration
- How would you integrate a relational database with a web application?
- What considerations are important when designing databases that interact with applications?

### Choosing a Database System
- How do you decide between using a relational database like MySQL and a NoSQL database like MongoDB?
- Describe a scenario where a NoSQL database might be more appropriate than a relational database.

## Personal Reflection and Learning

### Reflection on Learning Outcomes
- How has learning about databases changed the way you approach data-related problems?
- What was the most challenging database concept or assignment for you, and how did you overcome it?
- What advice would you give future students about approaching database management and SQL for the first time?
