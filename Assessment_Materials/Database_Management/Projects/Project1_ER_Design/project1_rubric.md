# Project 1: Campus Club & Event Management – Analytic Grading Rubric

Use this rubric to evaluate each student’s conceptual data model (ER diagram) and accompanying documentation. The total possible score is **100%**. Each criterion is weighted as shown.

| **Criterion**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Excellent (A)**                                                                                                                                                          | **Good (B)**                                                                                                                                                        | **Fair (C)**                                                                                                                                                | **Poor (D/F)**                                                                                                                                   | **Weight** |

| **1. Completeness**        | How well does the student address **all** required aspects of the project (clubs, members, events, venues, sponsorship, etc.)? Are optional or advanced features included (if applicable)?                                                              | **36–40 pts**<br>- All core requirements met in detail.<br>- Addresses optional features thoughtfully.<br>- Exhibits thorough understanding of the scenario.                                                       | **32–35 pts**<br>- All key requirements addressed.<br>- May not include optional aspects or some details are minorly incomplete.                                                                                | **28–31 pts**<br>- Some requirements not fully addressed (e.g., missing an entity or a key relationship).<br>- Coverage of scenario is partial or lacks detail.                                                | **0–27 pts**<br>- Multiple key requirements missing or incomplete.<br>- Submission shows limited effort in meeting the assignment scope.                                                           | **40%**    |
| **2. Accuracy**            | Are the **relationships** and **cardinalities** logically correct (1-to-M, M-to-N, etc.) based on the scenario?

| **4. Documentation**       | Did the student provide a **short explanation** of design choices and **list assumptions** clearly? Does this write-up show critical thinking about the scenario?                                                                                      | **9–10 pts**<br>- Comprehensive explanation of design decisions.<br>- Clearly stated assumptions align with real-world logic.<br>- Demonstrates thoughtful reflection.                                              | **8 pts**<br>- Solid explanation, though some assumptions may be under-explained or implicit.<br>- Mostly well-documented.                                                                                     | **7 pts**<br>- Minimal explanation, leaving some design choices unclear.<br>- Student omits several assumptions or does not justify them.                                                                    | **0–6 pts**<br>- Little to no explanation.<br>- Assumptions are absent, unclear, or contradict the scenario.                                                                                         | **10%**    |

## Scoring Guidelines
- **A (90–100%)**  
  Exemplary work that thoroughly meets or exceeds all requirements. The ER diagram is accurate, thorough, well-documented, and easy to interpret.

- **B (80–89%)**  
  Strong performance with most requirements addressed correctly. Minor errors or omissions but overall a solid conceptual design and presentation.

- **C (70–79%)**  
  Sufficient but shows gaps in requirements or logical accuracy. Diagram or explanations may need clarification or correction in multiple areas.

- **D/F (<70%)**  
  Significant problems with meeting requirements, accuracy, or clarity. Major aspects of the ER model are missing or incorrect, indicating limited understanding.
