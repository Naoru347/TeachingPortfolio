This guide provides a simplified overview of how to format and cite sources in APA style for your homework assignments. Following APA guidelines will help ensure clarity, professionalism, and proper academic integrity in your written work.

## Basic APA Formatting

- **Document Format:**
  - Use standard letter-sized paper (8.5" x 11").
  - Margins: 1-inch on all sides.
  - Font: Recommended fonts are Times New Roman (12 pt), Arial (11 pt), or Calibri (11 pt).
  - Line Spacing: Double-space your entire document, including references.
  - Alignment: Left-align the text and indent the first line of each paragraph by 0.5 inches (use the Tab key).

## Title and Heading Structure

- Use clear headings and subheadings to organize your document.
- Main headings should be bold and centered.
- Subheadings should be bold and left-aligned.

---

## Writing Clearly and Concisely

- Be specific and to the point. Avoid overly complicated language.
- Write in full sentences and paragraphs, not bullet points (unless specifically instructed otherwise).

---

## In-text Citations

If you use external resources (such as websites, articles, books), you must cite them using APA format within your text. The basic format for in-text citations is:

- For direct quotes: `(Author, Year, page number)`
- For paraphrasing: `(Author, Year)`

**Example:**  
Direct Quote:  
> "SQL aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value" (Coronel & Morris, 2020, p. 156).

Paraphrasing:  
> SQL aggregate functions are essential for summarizing data (Coronel & Morris, 2020).

## Reference List Formatting

At the end of your document, provide a reference list of all sources used. Title this section **References**, center-aligned and bolded.

- Each reference entry should have a hanging indent (the first line flush left, subsequent lines indented by 0.5 inches).
- Alphabetize references by the author's last name.

**Example of a Book Reference:**

Coronel, C., & Morris, S. (2020). *Database Systems: Design, Implementation, & Management* (14th ed.). Cengage Learning.

**Example of a Webpage Reference:**

Oracle. (2023). *SQL Aggregate Functions*. Retrieved from https://docs.oracle.com/
