# Homework: Course Concept Map

## Overview
In this final assignment, you will create a comprehensive **concept map** that visually represents how key database topics from this course connect to and build upon each other. This exercise helps you synthesize your learning and see the bigger picture of database design, querying, and administration.

---

## Objectives
1. **Visualize Course Topics**: Identify all major concepts from the semester (e.g., data modeling, normalization, SQL queries, transactions, administration, security).
2. **Show Relationships**: Illustrate how these topics interrelate (e.g., how normalization supports effective querying, or how transactions relate to backup/recovery).
3. **Reflect on Learning**: Demonstrate a clear understanding of how each module fits into the broader scope of database management.

## Instructions

1. **Brainstorm Key Topics**
   - Review lectures, homework, labs, and your own notes to identify the main concepts covered (data modeling, SQL, normalization, NoSQL, admin tasks, etc.).

2. **Draft the Structure**
   - Begin with a central theme (e.g., "Database Management") in the middle.
   - Branch out into major modules or sections (e.g., "Modeling," "SQL Querying," "Transactions," "Administration," etc.).
   - From each branch, detail subtopics (e.g., "Normalization," "ER Diagrams," "Joins and Subqueries," etc.).
   - You can review *sample_mind_map.png* for ideas on how to relate topics, but note that this sample **does not** go into the level of detail required for this assignment.

3. **Create the Concept Map**
   - Use any software or medium you prefer (hand-drawn map on paper, a digital tool like Lucidchart/Draw.io, or presentation software).
     - Note that *sample_mind_map.png* was created in *Lucidchart* using a free account.
   - Connect related topics with lines or arrows, adding short labels on relationships if needed.
   - The final map should be **legible**, **organized**, and **clear**.

4. **Include Brief Annotations**
   - For each major topic, add a short note (one to two sentences) explaining how it connects to adjacent topics.
   - Example: "**ER Diagrams** → define entities for **Normalization**, ensuring each table is structured correctly."

5. **Submission**
   - Export your concept map as a PDF, PNG, or JPEG.
   - Write a short (100–200 words) reflection on how creating this map helped you see the course content in a new light.
   - As always be sure to document relevant sources in either APA or IEEE format.

## Grading Criteria
- **Completeness (40%)**: Inclusion of all major topics from the course and their connections.
- **Organization & Clarity (30%)**: Concept map is visually clear, logically structured, and easy to follow.
- **Annotations & Reflection (20%)**: Concise, meaningful notes on relationships, plus a short reflection on learning.
- **Presentation (10%)**: Overall neatness, readability, and coherence.
