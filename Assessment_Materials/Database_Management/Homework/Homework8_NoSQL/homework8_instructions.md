# Homework: Relational vs. NoSQL Databases

## Overview
This homework will guide you through researching, comparing, and contrasting relational databases with NoSQL databases—particularly MongoDB. By exploring the differences in data models, query languages, performance considerations, and typical use cases, you'll deepen your understanding of when and why each type of database might be used.

## Objectives
1. **Identify core differences** between relational and NoSQL databases (schema, data model, query methods).
2. **Explain advantages and disadvantages** of each approach.
3. **Provide real-world scenarios** where each type excels.
4. **Demonstrate critical thinking** through analysis and concise presentation of findings.

## Instructions

1. **Gather Resources**
   - Review at least **two reputable sources** (articles, documentation, videos) discussing NoSQL vs. relational databases.
   - Focus on **MongoDB** as a NoSQL example.
   - Revisit your course materials for relational database fundamentals (e.g., normalization, SQL queries).
   - Keep a list of your resources in either APA or IEEE format, as this will streamline your documentation work later on.

2. **Compare & Contrast**
   - **Data Model:** Explore how data is stored in relational vs. NoSQL systems (tables vs. collections/documents, schemas vs. schema-less).
   - **Query Language & Methods:** Compare SQL with MongoDB’s document-based queries.
   - **Scalability & Performance:** Consider how each handles large datasets, distribution, and read/write workloads.
   - **Use Cases:** Outline at least one practical scenario for each database type.

3. **Create a Comparison Table** *(1–2 pages)*
   - Columns (Example): **Feature**, **Relational DBs (SQL)**, **MongoDB (NoSQL)**
   - Rows (Example): Schema Model, Query Language, Data Relationships, Transaction Support, Scalability, Typical Use Cases

4. **Write a Short Essay** *(300–500 words)*
   - **Introduction:** Briefly define relational and NoSQL databases.
   - **Key Differences:** Summarize insights from your comparison table.
   - **Advantages & Disadvantages:** Highlight pros/cons of each approach.
   - **Conclusion:** Suggest when and why you might choose one over the other.
   - **References:** Provide a complete list of APA or IEEE references that pair with in-text citations in the above sections.

5. **Cite Sources**
   - Include in-text references to any articles or documentation.
   - Provide a brief **References** section (APA or IEEE).

6. **Submit Your Work**
   - Compile your **Comparison Table** and **Essay** into a single PDF.
   - Upload to the LMS by **[Insert Due Date Here]**.
