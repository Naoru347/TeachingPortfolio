# Final Project – Analytic Grading Rubric

Below is the rubric for evaluating your final project. The total possible score is **100%**. Each criterion is weighted according to the percentages stated in the assignment prompt.

| **1. Database Design** (30%)       | Quality and completeness of the ER diagram and relational schema, including keys, relationships, normalization, and data types.                                                                          | **27–30 pts**<br>- Comprehensive and accurate ER diagram.<br>- Relationships, cardinalities, and constraints (PK, FK) are correct.<br>- Appropriate normalization, no redundant data.<br>- Data types well chosen. | **24–26 pts**<br>- Mostly accurate ER diagram with minor issues.<br>- Relationships and keys generally correct, though a few improvements possible.<br>- Minor normalization or data type concerns.       | **21–23 pts**<br>- Noticeable errors in relationships or constraints.<br>- Some normalization issues or incorrect data types.<br>- Overall design requires multiple corrections.                       | **0–20 pts**<br>- Major flaws in ER diagram or schema, e.g., missing critical entities/relationships.<br>- Frequent normalization issues or improper data types.<br>- Design fails to match requirements. | **30%**    |
| **2. Implementation & Data** (30%) | Accuracy of DDL (CREATE TABLE, etc.) and data insertion (INSERT). Adequate sample data demonstrates system functionality. Optional advanced features (stored procedures/triggers) included and working.      | **27–30 pts**<br>- Tables created correctly with proper constraints.<br>- Sufficient, realistic sample data covers a variety of use cases.<br>- Any advanced features (e.g., procedures/triggers) function well. | **24–26 pts**<br>- Tables generally correct with minor DDL issues.<br>- Data set is adequate, though some improvements in realism or variety possible.<br>- Advanced features partly implemented or basic. | **21–23 pts**<br>- Some DDL errors or missing constraints.<br>- Insufficient or simplistic sample data.<br>- Advanced features largely absent or have errors.                                             | **0–20 pts**<br>- Significant DDL errors or incomplete tables.<br>- Very limited or unrealistic data set.<br>- No attempt at advanced features, or they fail to function.                               | **30%**    |
| **3. Query Quality** (20%)         | Variety and correctness of SQL queries (SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY, subqueries, etc.). Accuracy and clarity of results for relevant business operations (e.g., top-selling products, patient appointments).   | **18–20 pts**<br>- Broad range of queries demonstrating complex operations (joins, aggregates, subqueries).<br>- Queries run without errors and produce logically correct results.                           | **16–17 pts**<br>- Covers most standard query types (joins, grouping).<br>- Minor issues or missed opportunities for advanced querying (subqueries, etc.), but overall functional.                      | **14–15 pts**<br>- Limited variety of queries (mostly basic SELECT statements).<br>- Some queries produce errors or incorrect results.                                                                  | **0–13 pts**<br>- Queries are incomplete, incorrect, or produce frequent errors.<br>- Little evidence of understanding beyond simple SELECT statements.                                               | **20%**    |
| **4. Documentation & Clarity** (20%) | Thoroughness of explanations (design rationale, assumptions). Ease of following instructions to run/test the system. Overall clarity of submission (naming conventions, file structure).                    | **18–20 pts**<br>- Clear, well-structured documentation describing decisions, assumptions, and usage steps.<br>- Easy to follow, with consistent naming conventions and excellent organization.              | **16–17 pts**<br>- Documentation addresses most major points, though some details could be clearer.<br>- Submission is mostly organized; minor inconsistencies in naming or structure.                   | **14–15 pts**<br>- Documentation is minimal or omits key assumptions/design choices.<br>- Organization is acceptable but could be improved for clarity.                                               | **0–13 pts**<br>- Poor or missing documentation. Hard to understand the design or how to run/test. Inconsistent or unclear naming and structure.                                                       | **20%**    |

## Score Interpretation

- **A (90–100%)**  
  Exemplary achievement across all criteria. The project is meticulously designed, well-documented, and demonstrates strong SQL and database skills.

- **B (80–89%)**  
  Solid coverage of requirements with minor gaps or errors. Overall, the project is functional and well-executed, though some details may need refinement.

- **C (70–79%)**  
  Adequate fulfillment of the basic requirements, but with noticeable weaknesses in design, data, queries, or clarity. The project works but requires multiple corrections.

- **D/F (<70%)**  
  Serious problems with completeness, correctness, or clarity. The submission fails to meet the essential requirements of the final project.

Use this rubric to guide your work and self-assess as you progress. Good luck!
