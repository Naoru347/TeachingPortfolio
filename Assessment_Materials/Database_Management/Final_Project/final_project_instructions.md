# Final Project: Comprehensive Database Design & Implementation

## Overview
For your final project, you will **choose one** of the following **three scenarios** to design and implement a **fully functional** database system:

1. **Medical Clinic Management System**  
   - **Concept**: Manage patient records, appointments, prescriptions, and billing for a small clinic or doctor’s office.

2. **Online Marketplace / E-Commerce**  
   - **Concept**: Track products, categories, inventory, customer orders, and shipments in a robust e-commerce platform.

3. **Student Information & Analytics Portal**  
   - **Concept**: Oversee student enrollment, courses, grades, attendance, and extracurriculars for an educational institution.

Regardless of which scenario you pick, you must deliver a **comprehensive project** that showcases **data modeling**, **database creation**, **querying**, and **documentation**. The requirements below ensure consistency across all students, while the **business problem** itself may vary.

## Project Requirements

### 1. **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram**  
- **Design**: Begin by creating a **conceptual model** to illustrate the entities, attributes, and relationships in your chosen system.  
- **Notation**: Use Chen’s or Crow’s Foot notation.  
- **Completeness**: Include all key entities (patients/doctors, products/customers, students/courses, etc.), relevant attributes, and correct cardinalities.  
- **Submission**: Provide the ER diagram as an image or PDF.

### 2. **Relational Schema & DDL Script**  
- **Schema**: Convert your ER diagram into a relational schema (tables, columns, relationships).  
- **Create Tables**: Write **SQL DDL** statements (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE) including:  
  - **Primary Keys** for each table.  
  - **Foreign Keys** to represent relationships.  
  - **Constraints** (CHECK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL) where appropriate.  
- **Data Types**: Choose data types carefully (e.g., DECIMAL for money, DATE/TIME for appointments).  
- **Indexes** (Optional but Encouraged): If relevant (e.g., frequently searched columns), create one or more indexes to optimize queries.

### 3. **Sample Data & DML Script**  
- **INSERT Statements**: Populate each table with **realistic sample data** reflecting different use cases (e.g., multiple patients with different appointments, products with varying prices/stock, students enrolled in multiple courses).  
- **Volume of Data**: Include enough records (50–100+ total rows spread across tables) to demonstrate meaningful queries and relationships.  
- **Consistency**: Ensure data aligns logically (e.g., appointments must not overlap if that’s part of your constraint, order items map to valid products, students have valid grades for valid courses).

### 4. **Core Queries & Operations**  
Provide a range of **SQL queries** that reflect key operations in your chosen scenario. Examples:

1. **Basic SELECT & Filtering**: Show a list of all items/patients/students with certain conditions.  
2. **JOINs**: Combine data from multiple tables to produce meaningful results (e.g., invoice details, combined product/category info, or course enrollment details).  
3. **GROUP BY & Aggregations**: Summarize data (e.g., total revenue, count of appointments, average GPA).  
4. **Subqueries or Complex Logic**: Show advanced queries (e.g., best-selling products, top doctors by patient count, or students on academic probation).  
5. **Updates & Inserts**: Demonstrate at least one **UPDATE** (e.g., adjust inventory or appointment time) and **INSERT** (e.g., add a new user or record) to show data modification.

### 5. **Stored Procedures / Triggers (Optional but Recommended)**  
- Implement at least **one** advanced feature to show your command of **database automation** or logic:  
  - **Stored Procedure**: E.g., generate monthly statements, re-order alerts, or academic status updates.  
  - **Trigger**: E.g., prevent double booking, maintain derived columns (like total invoice amounts), or auto-timestamp updates.  
- If you choose not to include these, be sure to provide a justification.

### 6. **Documentation**  
- **Design Rationale**: Explain why you structured your database the way you did (e.g., how you decided the relationships, constraints).  
- **Assumptions**: State any assumptions about the business logic (e.g., “We assume each patient can have only one appointment per time slot,” or “We allow multiple open orders per customer”).  
- **Instructions**: Describe how someone can run your scripts and test your database (including any environment/version notes).  
- **User Scenarios** (Optional): Provide examples of how the database is meant to be used in real life.

### 7. **Submission Format**  
- Provide the following components in a well-structured manner:
  1. **ER Diagram** (image/PDF).  
  2. **DDL Script** (e.g., `create_final_project.sql`).  
  3. **DML Script** with sample data (e.g., `insert_final_project_data.sql`).  
  4. **SQL Queries** (plus optional stored procedures/triggers) in a separate file (e.g., `queries_final_project.sql`).  
  5. **Documentation** (PDF, Word, or Markdown) summarizing design and usage.  

- Use **clear file names** with your last name, e.g., `Lastname_FinalProject_DDL.sql`.

## Grading Criteria

Your final project will be evaluated on:

1. **Database Design (30%)**  
   - Correct ER diagram and relational schema, including keys and relationships.  
   - Appropriate use of constraints, normalization, and data types.

2. **Implementation & Data (30%)**  
   - Proper table creation with accurate relationships.  
   - Sufficient, realistic sample data.  
   - Optional advanced features (stored procedures, triggers) implemented properly.

3. **Query Quality (20%)**  
   - Demonstration of a variety of queries (joins, aggregates, subqueries, updates).  
   - Logical accuracy and efficiency of queries.

4. **Documentation & Clarity (20%)**  
   - Thorough explanation of design decisions and assumptions.  
   - Instructions for setup/testing.  
   - Clear, well-structured, and easy to follow.

## Tips for Success

- **Plan First**: Sketch your schema and list out the real-world workflows (e.g., booking appointments, placing orders, enrolling students) before coding.  
- **Test Often**: Insert data and run your queries frequently to spot logical mistakes early.  
- **Stay Consistent**: Use a consistent naming convention for tables and columns.  
- **Aim High**: Consider including **stored procedures**, **triggers**, or **views** to differentiate your project and gain experience with advanced database features.
