# Project 1: Small Business Security Assessment

## Overview
In this project, you will step into the role of a cybersecurity consultant. Your task is to analyze the current cybersecurity posture of a fictional small business and provide a set of clear, actionable recommendations that would improve its overall security. Your final deliverable will be a **2–3 page executive summary** written for a **non-technical audience** (e.g., a small business owner).

## Scenario
You’ve been hired to review the IT and security setup for **Mason Legal Group**, a small but growing law office located in a suburban commercial complex. The firm has 10 full-time employees, including attorneys, paralegals, and an office manager who also oversees basic IT tasks. The office handles sensitive legal documents, contracts, and privileged client communications daily, which are often shared via email and stored in cloud platforms.

The office’s current IT and security setup includes:

- A small local network of 10 Windows desktops connected via a consumer-grade switch
- A Wi-Fi router with default settings still enabled, including unchanged admin credentials and open WPS access
- No centralized user account management or directory services; machines use individual local logins
- Shared accounts and passwords for legal research tools and calendaring systems
- File storage is handled entirely through shared Dropbox folders with basic link-based permissions
- Employees often use personal laptops or tablets when working from home or client sites, accessing documents over public Wi-Fi
- No VPN in place for remote work
- No antivirus or endpoint protection software installed on company devices
- Email communications are managed via a standard hosted Gmail account without enforced 2FA
- No formal cybersecurity policies, training, or incident response procedures in place

The firm has not experienced a known security incident, but the managing partner is concerned about rising cyber threats and wants a clearer understanding of their current risks and what they can do to better protect their data and clients.

## Your Task
You will take on the role of an entry-level cybersecurity analyst tasked with evaluating and advising a small law office. This assignment is broken into three components:

1. **Analyze the Current Setup**
   - Review the network, devices, user behaviors, and services described in the scenario.
   - Identify key vulnerabilities and risks — both technical (e.g., lack of antivirus, weak passwords) and human (e.g., lack of training, password sharing).
   - Consider the organization’s business needs and constraints as you prioritize the most pressing threats.
   - Think critically about how different vulnerabilities might interact (e.g., no antivirus + public Wi-Fi = high malware risk).

2. **Recommend Improvements**
   - Propose **at least five concrete, realistic, and affordable improvements** that the firm could implement.
   - Recommendations should address both:
     - **Technical protections** (e.g., enabling multi-factor authentication, deploying endpoint protection, router hardening)
     - **Procedural or policy changes** (e.g., implementing password management, employee training, establishing a basic incident response plan)
   - Each recommendation should include a brief rationale that explains its impact, feasibility, and why it’s appropriate for a small business environment.
   - Bonus: categorize your recommendations using a common framework (e.g., administrative, technical, physical controls) if you'd like to demonstrate deeper understanding.

3. **Write an Executive Summary**
   - Write a **2–3 page executive summary** that communicates your analysis and recommendations clearly and persuasively to a non-technical audience (e.g., the firm’s managing partner).
   - Use clear formatting, section headers, and bullet points to improve readability.
   - Avoid jargon. Use analogies or plain language to explain key concepts when necessary.
   - Your summary should include:
     - **An introduction** summarizing the scope of your assessment
     - **A concise risk analysis** identifying the main areas of concern
     - **Your top 5+ recommendations** with clear justifications
     - **A conclusion** that emphasizes the importance of action and the benefits of your proposed changes (e.g., protecting client data, reducing liability, improving operational resilience)

## Deliverables
- **Executive Summary (2–3 pages)**: PDF format, named `Lastname_Firstname_Project1.pdf`
- Use clear formatting, bullet points, and headings to improve readability

## Tools & Format
- **Word processor**: Use Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or a similar tool.
- **Formatting**: Your executive summary must be written in **college APA format**, including:
  - 12-point Times New Roman, Arial, Garamond, or Aptos font, double-spaced text, and 1-inch margins
  - Clear section headings for readability
  - In-text citations for any external sources used (e.g., NIST guidelines, vendor documentation, course readings)
  - A **References** page at the end with properly formatted APA citations
- **Submission**: Export your final document as a PDF and upload it to the course LMS.
- **Optional**: You may include a simple annotated diagram of the office network setup if it helps illustrate your analysis, but this is not required.

Be sure to cite any sources you consult, even if you're paraphrasing. Demonstrating responsible use of authoritative resources strengthens your credibility and helps develop professional habits for cybersecurity work.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your work will be assessed on:

1. **Analysis (40%)** – Have you accurately identified key risks and vulnerabilities?
2. **Recommendations (30%)** – Are your suggestions realistic, appropriate, and clearly explained?
3. **Clarity (20%)** – Is your summary well-written, structured, and accessible to non-technical readers?
4. **Professional Tone (10%)** – Is your work polished, professional, and persuasive in tone?

## Tips for Success
- Think like a consultant: What would a small business owner need to hear to be convinced to act?
- Don’t overwhelm with overly technical advice—focus on practical steps
- Prioritize recommendations that provide the most impact for the least cost
- Re-read your summary to ensure clarity and accessibility
- Proofread carefully for tone and grammar

**This is your chance to show how well you understand real-world cybersecurity risks and how to translate that understanding into meaningful advice. Good luck!**
