# Project 3: Internal Security Policy Development

## Overview
In this final project, you will adopt the role of a security analyst or IT administrator responsible for creating an **Internal Security Policy** for a small organization. Your job is to create a concise, clear, and practical document that outlines how the organization will protect its information systems, users, and data.

This project emphasizes your ability to apply security principles to real-world contexts and communicate them in a professional and understandable way.

---

## Scenario
You have been hired by a small business or nonprofit to help them take their first steps toward cybersecurity maturity. The organization may not yet have formal policies in place. You will choose a hypothetical organization — such as:
- A private medical clinic
- A nonprofit working with vulnerable populations
- A small tech startup
- A public library system
- A college tutoring center

Your job is to develop a complete **Internal Security Policy Package** that fits the needs and risks of that specific context.

---

## Your Task
Your final submission will consist of three main components:

### 1. **Select and Define Your Organization**
- Choose a fictional but realistic organization from a specific industry or service area
- Describe the organization’s size, mission, and typical operations (2–3 paragraphs)
- Identify at least 3–5 relevant cybersecurity concerns based on its domain (e.g., HIPAA risks for a clinic, data integrity for a nonprofit)

### 2. **Write the Internal Security Policy Document (2–4 pages)**
Your policy should include the following sections:
- **Acceptable Use Policy** – What employees are allowed and not allowed to do on work systems
- **Password Standards** – Requirements for password complexity, change frequency, and management
- **Device & Remote Work Guidelines** – Expectations for using personal/work devices, encryption, and secure connections
- **Incident Reporting Procedures** – How employees should report suspicious behavior, breaches, or system failures

In addition:
- Reference **at least three industry standards** (e.g., NIST, CIS, ISO/IEC 27001)
- Cite all sources using **APA in-text citations** and include a **References page**

### 3. **Design Two User Training Artifacts**
Create two short, user-focused materials that will help staff understand and comply with your policy. These may include:
- A one-page infographic (e.g., password best practices)
- A slide deck for new employee training
- A quick reference handout or internal FAQ
- A short email or memo introducing a policy change

Artifacts should be:
- Accessible and non-technical
- Visually organized and readable
- Tied directly to the key points in your security policy

---

## Deliverables
Submit the following materials as a **PDF bundle or zipped folder** via the course LMS:

1. **Internal Security Policy Document (2–4 pages)**
   - APA format: title page, in-text citations, and references
   - 12 pt Times New Roman, double-spaced, 1-inch margins

2. **Two User Training Artifacts**
   - Each artifact submitted as a separate PDF or embedded in the policy document appendix

3. **File Naming Convention**
   - Use: `Lastname_Firstname_Project3.pdf` (or `.zip` if submitting multiple files)

## Evaluation Criteria
| **Criterion**                     | **Weight** |
|----------------------------------|------------|
| Realism and Relevance            | 25%        |
| Clarity and Structure            | 25%        |
| Integration of Standards         | 30%        |
| Professional Tone & APA Format  | 10%        |
| Training Artifacts (clarity + relevance) | 10% |

---

## Tips for Success
- Choose a domain you’re interested in or familiar with
- Think about how your policy would actually be used day-to-day
- Keep language accessible to a general audience — especially for training materials
- Use bullet points, headings, and formatting to improve readability
- Use real-world frameworks to guide your work, but tailor them to your fictional org

This project gives you a chance to demonstrate both technical knowledge and communication skill. If done well, your submission can serve as a strong addition to a professional portfolio. Good luck!
