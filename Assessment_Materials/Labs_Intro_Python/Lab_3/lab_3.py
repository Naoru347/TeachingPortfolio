# Lab 3: Decision Making Programs
# Starter Code

def main():
    # TODO: Prompt the user to enter their current percentage score in the class
    # Hint: Use the input() function and remember to convert the input to an integer

    # TODO: Implement decision logic to check if the user is passing the class
    # Use if-else statements to print the appropriate message:
    # "You are probably going to pass the class." or "You are probably not going to pass the class."

    # TODO: Prompt the user to enter a number to check if it is even or odd
    # Hint: Use the modulo operator (%) to determine even or odd numbers
    # Example: even numbers have no remainder when divided by 2 (num % 2 == 0)

    # TODO: Implement decision logic to print if the number is even or odd
    # Use if-else statements to print:
    # "The number is even." or "The number is odd."

    # TEMPORARY CODE (DELETE AFTER COMPLETING TODOs)
    print("Remember to complete all TODOs!")

# Check if the script is being run directly
