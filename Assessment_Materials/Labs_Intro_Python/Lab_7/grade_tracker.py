# Lab 7: Grade Tracker Starter Script

# Step 1: Setup
# Define a list of grades (replace these with your own values)
grades = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]

# Print the grades list
print("Initial grades:", grades)

# Calculate and print the average grade (you can replace this with a loop)
average = sum(grades) / len(grades)
print("Average grade:", average)

# Step 2: Manipulation
# Add, remove, and slice grades here

# Step 3: Analysis
# Iterate through grades and determine Pass/Fail

# Define the grade_summary function here
def grade_summary(grades):
    # Calculate highest, lowest, and average grades
    pass  # Replace this with your implementation

# Step 4: User Interaction
# Prompt user for a new grade and check if a grade exists in the list
