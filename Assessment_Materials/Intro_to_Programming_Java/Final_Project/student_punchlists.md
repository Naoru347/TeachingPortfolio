# Project Punchlists for Final Assignment (Java Edition)

## 1. Data Science: Data Analysis and Visualization Tool

### Week 9–10: Kickoff and Proposal
- [ ] Review the starter Java code and ensure it compiles and runs properly.
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the provided dataset or locate a suitable CSV dataset.
- [ ] Brainstorm possible data processing enhancements and visualization goals.
- [ ] Submit a proposal with at least two enhancements and ideas for two visualizations.

### Week 11: Starter Code Walkthrough
- [ ] Attend the walkthrough session and clarify questions about the Java code structure.
- [ ] Outline a plan for implementing filtering, sorting, or aggregation methods.
- [ ] Explore visualization options using Java libraries like JFreeChart, JavaFX Charts, or XChart.

### Week 12: Progress Check 1
- [ ] Implement one data processing feature (e.g., filtering or sorting).
- [ ] Create a basic visualization (e.g., a bar chart).
- [ ] Test the feature and visualization for correctness and clarity.

### Week 13: Progress Check 2
- [ ] Add a second data processing feature (e.g., aggregation or grouping).
- [ ] Implement an additional visualization (e.g., line or scatter plot).
- [ ] Refine command-line or GUI-based user interaction for inputs and display.

### Week 14: Peer Review Session
- [ ] Share your project with classmates and gather feedback on usability and presentation.
- [ ] Note suggestions for improvement and iterate on your code accordingly.

### Week 15: Final Submission
- [ ] Confirm that all features and visualizations are functioning.
- [ ] Finalize your README and Reflection Paper.
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive testing before submission.

## 2. Computer Science and Engineering: Simulation or Algorithm Implementation

### Week 9–10: Kickoff and Proposal
- [ ] Run the starter Java code and understand its architecture.
- [ ] Decide on your project focus (e.g., traffic simulation, graph search).
- [ ] Brainstorm enhancements such as user input features or visual output.
- [ ] Submit a proposal outlining your core implementation plan and one or more enhancements.

### Week 11: Starter Code Walkthrough
- [ ] Attend the walkthrough session and clarify logic and structure of the starter code.

### Week 12: Progress Check 1
- [ ] Implement the base functionality (e.g., state changes or pathfinding).
- [ ] Test the simulation using default or hardcoded parameters.

### Week 13: Progress Check 2
- [ ] Add interactivity via user input (e.g., custom graph size or timing).
- [ ] Implement a visual representation (e.g., JavaFX or Swing GUI, ASCII display).
- [ ] Debug and improve simulation output and feedback to users.

### Week 14: Peer Review Session
- [ ] Share your program and receive feedback on code logic and simulation clarity.
- [ ] Address any suggestions for improved interactivity or structure.

### Week 15: Final Submission
- [ ] Ensure full functionality and enhancements are integrated.
