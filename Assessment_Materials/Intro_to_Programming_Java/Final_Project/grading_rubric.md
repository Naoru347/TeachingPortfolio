# Final Project Grading Rubric (Java Edition)

## **Overview**
This rubric will be used to evaluate your final Java project based on five key categories: **Core Functionality**, **Enhancements**, **Documentation**, **Reflection**, and **Code Quality**. Each category includes specific criteria, and the weight for each reflects its importance in the overall evaluation.

## **Grading Criteria**

### **1. Core Functionality (40%)**
#### **Criteria:**
- [ ] Required features in the starter code are fully implemented and functional.
- [ ] The application runs without major errors or crashes.
- [ ] The core features meet the requirements specified in the project prompt.
- [ ] The program handles edge cases effectively (e.g., invalid inputs, empty datasets, or null values).

| **Performance Level** | **Description**                                                                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Excellent (36–40)**  | All required features are implemented flawlessly. The application is robust and handles edge cases gracefully. |
| **Good (30–35)**       | Most required features are implemented with minor issues. Handles most edge cases appropriately.     |
| **Satisfactory (24–29)** | Some required features are implemented, but there are noticeable issues or missing functionality.   |
| **Needs Improvement (0–23)** | Required features are incomplete or non-functional. Edge cases are not handled effectively.     |

### **2. Enhancements (20%)**
#### **Criteria:**
- [ ] Enhancements add meaningful functionality or improve user experience.
- [ ] Additional features demonstrate creativity, problem-solving, and technical effort.
- [ ] Enhancements are well-integrated and do not interfere with core functionality.

| **Performance Level** | **Description**                                                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Excellent (18–20)**  | Enhancements are innovative, seamless, and significantly enrich the application.                     |
| **Good (15–17)**       | Enhancements are meaningful and mostly functional with minor issues.                                  |
| **Satisfactory (12–14)** | Enhancements are basic or partially functional but still add some value.                           |
| **Needs Improvement (0–11)** | Enhancements are minimal, buggy, or poorly integrated.                                        |

### **3. Documentation (20%)**
#### **Criteria:**
- [ ] README file is professional, clearly written, and easy to follow.
- [ ] Includes all required sections: Title, Description, Features, Installation, Usage, Reflection, and optional License/Acknowledgments.
- [ ] Java code is well-commented, explaining logic and structure of key components.
- [ ] Project directory is logically organized (e.g., separation of source files, data files, and documentation).

| **Performance Level** | **Description**                                                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Excellent (18–20)**  | README and code comments are comprehensive and professional. File structure is highly organized.      |
| **Good (15–17)**       | README and comments are clear, with most sections present. File structure is organized.               |
| **Satisfactory (12–14)** | README and comments are basic or incomplete. File structure is somewhat organized.                  |
| **Needs Improvement (0–11)** | Documentation is minimal, disorganized, or missing key elements.                              |

### **4. Reflection (10%)**
#### **Criteria:**
- [ ] Reflection offers thoughtful insights on project challenges and how they were addressed.
- [ ] Clearly connects the experience to academic or career goals.
- [ ] Demonstrates personal and technical growth.

| **Performance Level** | **Description**                                                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Excellent (9–10)**   | Reflection is deep, well-written, and shows strong connections to goals and learning.                 |
| **Good (7–8)**         | Reflection addresses challenges and learning with minor gaps in clarity or depth.                     |
| **Satisfactory (6)**   | Reflection is surface-level but addresses at least one challenge or learning takeaway.                |
| **Needs Improvement (0–5)** | Reflection is incomplete, vague, or lacks meaningful insight.                                  |

### **5. Code Quality (10%)**
#### **Criteria:**
- [ ] Code is readable and follows Java best practices (e.g., naming conventions, indentation, formatting).
- [ ] Code is modular, using classes and methods appropriately.
- [ ] Proper error handling is implemented (e.g., try/catch blocks).
- [ ] Code is efficient and avoids redundancy.

| **Performance Level** | **Description**                                                                                       |

## **Total Score**

The total score will be calculated using the following weights:

- **Core Functionality:** 40%
- **Enhancements:** 20%
- **Documentation:** 20%
- **Reflection:** 10%
- **Code Quality:** 10%

**Example Calculation:**

If a project scores:
- Core Functionality: 36/40  
- Enhancements: 18/20  
- Documentation: 17/20  
- Reflection: 8/10  
- Code Quality: 9/10  

Then the final score will be:

Final Score = (36 × 0.4) + (18 × 0.2) + (17 × 0.2) + (8 × 0.1) + (9 × 0.1) = 14.4 + 3.6 + 3.4 + 0.8 + 0.9 = 43.1 / 50 = 86.2%
