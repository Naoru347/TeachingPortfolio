# Peer Review Guide: Final Project (Java Edition)

## **Purpose of Peer Review**
Peer review is a valuable opportunity to receive feedback from your classmates to improve your Java application. It helps you identify areas for refinement and explore different approaches to solving similar programming challenges. Use this guide to provide constructive, specific, and actionable feedback.

---

## **Activity Overview**
In your group of 3–4 students:
1. Each member will take turns presenting their Java project.
2. Group members will provide feedback using the structured criteria below.
3. Each student will leave with a clear plan for next steps to improve their project before the final submission.

---

## **Steps for Peer Review**

### **1. Presentation (5 minutes per student)**

Each student should present the following:
- Which project option you chose (Data Analysis & Visualization, Simulation/Algorithm, or Secure Login System).
- The core functionality you’ve implemented so far.
- Any enhancements or additional features added.
- One part of the project you're proud of.
- One part you're unsure about or would like feedback on.

---

### **2. Guided Group Feedback (10 minutes per project)**

Group members should provide feedback on the following five areas:

#### **A. Usability**
- Is the application intuitive and easy to interact with?
- Are user inputs clearly prompted, and are outputs understandable?
- Are error messages informative and helpful?

#### **B. Functionality**
- Does the program run without major errors or crashes?
- Are all required features (from the starter code) implemented successfully?
- Do any enhancements improve the program’s utility or experience?

#### **C. Design and Clarity**
- **For Data Projects:** Are visualizations (e.g., from JFreeChart or JavaFX) accurate, relevant, and well-designed?
- **For Simulations/Algorithms:** Are outputs (e.g., logs, graphs) clear and understandable?
- **For Secure Login Systems:** Are security measures (e.g., password hashing, authentication steps) implemented correctly and user-friendly?

#### **D. Code Quality**
- Is the code clean, organized, and easy to read?
- Are functions and classes used effectively?
- Are comments meaningful and present where needed?
- Could any code be refactored or optimized?

#### **E. Documentation**
- Does the README clearly explain the project’s purpose and features?
- Are installation or setup instructions easy to follow?
- Is there a clear explanation of how this project connects to the student's career interests?

### **3. Written Feedback**

Each group member will write and share feedback using the following format:

- **Strengths:**  
  List 2–3 things the presenter did well.

- **Suggestions:**  
  List 2–3 specific, constructive suggestions for improvement.

- **Questions:**  
  Ask 1–2 thoughtful questions to prompt deeper reflection or clarity.

---

## **Guidelines for Constructive Feedback**

- **Be Specific:**  
  Avoid vague comments like “It looks good.” Instead, say, “I liked how you implemented the graph using Dijkstra’s algorithm and included user-defined start and end nodes.”

- **Be Respectful:**  
  Frame all comments in a way that promotes a positive, collaborative learning environment.

- **Be Balanced:**  
  Highlight areas of strength and areas for improvement equally.

---

## **Post-Review Reflection**

After the peer review session, take 5–10 minutes to reflect on the feedback you received:
- Summarize key feedback points.
- Identify 1–2 actionable steps you plan to take.
- Consider discussing questions or concerns with your instructor during office hours.

---

## **Deliverables**

1. **Written Feedback** for each group member (submit or share at the end of the session).
2. **Feedback Summary** for yourself:  
   - Key takeaways  
   - Action steps  
3. **Updated Project Plan**: Submit a short update via the course LMS (by **DATE**) outlining what you plan to change or improve based on feedback.

Let’s make this peer review session as helpful, specific, and supportive as possible!
