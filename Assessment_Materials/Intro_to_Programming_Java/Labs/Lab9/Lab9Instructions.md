# **Lab 9: Midterm Project Work and Collaboration Report (Java Edition)**

---

## **Objectives**
1. Use lab time effectively to develop your **Java-based** midterm project.
2. Collaborate with your team to make meaningful, testable progress on your application.
3. Reflect on individual contributions and team dynamics through clear, well-structured reports.

---

## **Instructions**

### **Part 1: Java Project Development**

1. **Continue Developing Your Java Midterm Project**:
   - Use this lab session to focus on building **core functionality** as outlined in your project plan.
   - Work from your team’s **GitHub repository** using the directory structure set up in Lab 8 (`/src`, `/docs`, etc.).
   - Use your IDE (e.g., VS Code or IntelliJ) to compile, run, and debug your program as a team.

2. **Break Down and Assign Tasks**:
   - Examples:
     - One member implements a Java class or method.
     - Another writes JUnit test cases.
     - Another reviews code or handles user input logic.
   - Use clear naming conventions and modular methods for efficient integration.

3. **Collaborate Actively**:
   - Pair program when helpful.
   - Ask questions, brainstorm, and debug together.
   - Use GitHub issues, branches, and commits to track tasks and updates.

4. **Track Your Work in GitHub**:
   - Push and pull changes frequently.
   - Write **descriptive commit messages**, e.g.,  
     ```
     Added TaskManager class with addTask() and removeTask() methods
     ```

### **Part 2: Effort Reports**

Each team member will submit a **one-page document**, split into two sections:

#### **1. Individual Effort Report**
- Summarize **your contributions** during this lab session.
- Note any **Java-specific challenges** (e.g., syntax issues, logic bugs, or object design problems) and how you addressed them.
- Share **one learning takeaway**, such as:
  - Gained experience using `ArrayList` or `Scanner`.
  - Learned to resolve a Git merge conflict.
  - Improved debugging skills with `System.out.println()` and test-driven development.

#### **2. Group Effort Report**
- Collaboratively write a summary of **what your team accomplished** today.
- Include:
  - Core functionality completed (e.g., “Basic menu system implemented” or “Initial class structure complete”).
  - Any blockers or technical challenges.
  - Notes on team communication and workflow (What worked well? What could improve?).
- List **all team members** who contributed to the report.

---

## **Submission Instructions**
1. Submit a **single PDF** to the course LMS containing:
   - Your **Individual Effort Report** (each student submits separately).
   - Your team’s **Group Effort Report** (only one submission per team).
2. Reports should be well-written, clearly labeled, and free of grammar or spelling errors.

## **Hints and Tips**

### **Effective Collaboration**
- Use GitHub Projects, issues, or even a Google Doc to manage tasks.
- Keep your code modular — each person can work on a different class or method.
- Agree on naming conventions for classes, variables, and methods.

### **Effort Reporting**
- Keep notes during lab on what you worked on and discussed — makes writing the report easier.
- Include your debugging process or team discussions in the group reflection.

### **Java-Specific Suggestions**
- Run your code frequently to catch logic errors early.
- Use `Scanner` carefully (remember to handle newlines after reading integers!).
- Consider adding test methods using `JUnit` for any complex functionality.

### **For GitHub**
- Sync your branches often.
- If unsure about Git commands, ask a teammate or instructor.
