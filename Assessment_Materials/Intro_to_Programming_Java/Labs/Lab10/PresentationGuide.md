# **Lab 10: Midterm Project Presentations (Java Edition)**

---

## **Objectives**
1. Demonstrate your midterm project and explain its purpose and functionality.
2. Reflect on the development process, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
3. Practice presenting technical work effectively to an audience.
4. Provide constructive feedback to your peers.

## **Presentation Guidelines**
Each team will have **10 minutes** to present their Java project to the class. Use the time wisely to showcase your work, explain its functionality, and share insights from the development process.

### **Structure of the Presentation**

#### **1. Introduction (1-2 minutes)**
- **Team Members**:
  - Introduce your team members and their roles (e.g., Team Lead, Lead Developer, Tester).
- **Project Overview**:
  - Briefly describe your project theme (e.g., Text-Based Game, Utility Tool, or Data Explorer).
  - State the problem your project solves and the purpose of your application.

#### **2. Demo of Core Functionality (4-5 minutes)**
- **Showcase Key Features**:
  - Run your Java application and demonstrate its main functionality.
  - Highlight core features implemented and how they solve the problem.
- **Explain the Code**:
  - Walk through a few critical sections of your code (e.g., a method or control structure).
  - Keep it high-level and focus on important concepts rather than every detail.

### **Advice for Talking About Code**

1. **Start with the Big Picture**:
   - Briefly explain the purpose of the method or class before diving into specifics.
   - Example: "This method calculates the average of an array of numbers. It's a core part of our data analysis feature."

2. **Focus on Key Concepts**:
   - Highlight the logic behind the code (e.g., loops, conditionals, classes, objects) rather than reading it line-by-line.

3. **Use Visuals or Analogies**:
   - If possible, use a diagram or analogy to make the code more relatable.
   - Example: "Think of this `HashMap` as a dictionary where each key is a label and the value is the data."

4. **Simplify Technical Jargon**:
   - Avoid overly complex terms when simpler ones work just as well.

5. **Engage Your Audience**:
   - Pause to ask if your explanation makes sense.
   - Invite questions during or after the presentation.

6. **Be Honest About Challenges**:
   - It's okay to say, "This part of the code was tricky, and here's how we figured it out."

#### **3. Reflections (2-3 minutes)**
- **Challenges and Solutions**:
  - Discuss significant challenges your team faced during development.
  - Explain how you overcame them using Java features, collaboration, or debugging tools.
- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Share technical skills or teamwork lessons gained.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Briefly describe what you would improve if given more time.

#### **4. Questions and Feedback (1-2 minutes)**
- **Q&A Session**:
  - Invite your classmates and instructor to ask questions about your project.
- **Feedback**:
  - Ask for feedback on what your team did well and where you could improve.

## **Expectations for Audience Members**
1. **Be Engaged**:
   - Pay attention to each presentation and take notes.
2. **Ask Questions**:
   - Prepare at least one question for each team.
3. **Provide Feedback**:
   - Be constructive and supportive.

## **Submission Instructions**
1. Submit your presentation slides (if used) and final Java code to the course LMS before class.
2. Ensure your GitHub repository is up-to-date and includes:
   - Final code.
   - A polished `README.md` file.
   - Documentation of team contributions.

## **Hints and Tips**
1. **Practice Your Presentation**:
   - Rehearse as a team and assign speaking roles.
2. **Focus on Highlights**:
   - Prioritize showing key features and important parts of your Java code.
3. **Be Honest**:
   - Share real challenges and how you tackled them.
4. **Prepare for Questions**:
   - Be ready to explain your decisions and logic.
