# **Project Planning Guide: A Step-by-Step Resource (Java Edition)**

This guide will help you and your team plan and execute your midterm project successfully. Follow these steps to break the project into manageable tasks, assign roles, and stay on track to meet deadlines.

---

## **1. Understand the Project Requirements**

Before you dive into planning, make sure everyone in your team understands the project:

- **Review the Assignment Sheet:**
  - Highlight required features and enhancements.
  - Discuss how your chosen project option (Text-Based Game, Utility Tool, or Data Explorer) fits these requirements.
  
- **Ask Questions:**
  - Bring any unclear requirements to your instructor or lab session for clarification.

- **Identify Key Concepts:**
  - Review the programming concepts you’ll need:
    - Input/output handling.
    - Loops, conditionals, and methods.
    - String manipulation and basic data structures (arrays, ArrayLists, HashMaps).

---

## **2. Brainstorm and Define Project Goals**

- **Choose a Problem to Solve:**
  - What real-world task or challenge does your program address?
  - Write a brief one-sentence goal for your project. Example: "Create a text-based adventure game that tracks player progress and calculates their final score."

- **Define Core Features:**
  - List the minimum functionality your program needs to have. Example: “Accept user input, track scores, and display outcomes.”

- **Plan Enhancements:**
  - Think about additional features to improve the user experience or add complexity.

---

## **3. Define and Assign Team Roles**

Team collaboration is key to success. Most teams will have 2–3 members, so students may need to take on multiple roles. Each team must designate a **Project Manager** to oversee progress and deadlines.

### **Suggested Roles:**

1. **Project Manager:**  
   - Oversees the project timeline and ensures the team meets deadlines.
   - Keeps track of task assignments and checks in with team members regularly.
   - Maintains the Git repository, ensuring frequent commits and a clean history.
   - Coordinates the presentation and ensures the final deliverables are ready.

2. **Lead Developer:**  
   - Focuses on implementing the program's core functionality.
   - Writes the majority of the initial code, ensuring it follows Java best practices.
   - Collaborates with the Debugger/Tester to resolve issues.

3. **Enhancements Specialist:**  
   - Develops and integrates enhancements to the program.
   - Works with the Lead Developer to ensure enhancements don’t break existing functionality.
   - Researches and applies new Java techniques (e.g., advanced string methods, array manipulation, object-oriented techniques).

4. **Debugger/Tester:**  
   - Tests each feature as it’s developed, identifying and fixing bugs.
   - Creates test cases to ensure the program handles edge cases and invalid input.
   - Provides feedback to the team on potential improvements.

5. **Documentation Specialist:**  
   - Writes and updates the README file with a clear description of the program, features, and usage instructions.
   - Adds meaningful comments to the code to explain its logic.
   - Prepares the team’s portion of the presentation.

### **Notes on Roles:**
- Some students will need to take on multiple roles.
- Discuss each team member’s strengths and interests to assign roles effectively.
- All team members are responsible for contributing to the project, regardless of role.

## **4. Plan the Work**

Use the following steps to divide the project into phases:

1. **Break Down Features:**
   - Write down all features to be implemented (core functionality and enhancements).
   - Split them into smaller, manageable tasks.

2. **Create a Timeline:**
   - Align tasks with the project milestones:
     - **Week 8:** Proposal and initial setup.
     - **Week 9:** Core functionality.
     - **Week 10:** Enhancements, testing, and final submission.

3. **Assign Tasks:**
   - Assign each task to a team member based on their role.
   - Set specific deadlines for each task to ensure progress.

4. **Check Progress Regularly:**
   - Hold short team check-ins (10–15 minutes) at least twice a week to discuss progress and challenges.

## **5. Design the Program**

Before coding, plan how your program will work:

- **Write Pseudocode:**  
  Outline the logic for key sections of your program in plain language.

- **Draw a Flowchart (Optional):**  
  Visualize how the program will flow, from user input to output.

- **Plan Methods:**  
  Decide which parts of the program will be modularized into methods.  
  Example:
  - Method 1: Get and validate user input.
  - Method 2: Process input and perform calculations.
  - Method 3: Display output.

- **Define Data Structures:**  
  Identify whether you’ll use arrays, ArrayLists, HashMaps, or a combination of these to manage your program’s data.

---

## **6. Set Up Your Environment**

- **Version Control:**
  - Create a shared Git repository for your team.
  - Practice basic Git commands (`commit`, `push`, `pull`) to avoid conflicts.
  - Use meaningful commit messages to document changes.

- **Coding Environment:**
  - Ensure all team members have Java installed and are using the same IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
  - Use a consistent code style (e.g., Java conventions like camelCase for variables and PascalCase for classes).

---

## **7. Develop the Program**

Follow these steps to implement your project:

1. **Start Small:**  
   - Focus on getting the core functionality working first. Test as you go.

2. **Work in Iterations:**  
   - Complete one feature at a time before moving on to the next.

3. **Integrate Enhancements:**  
   - Once the basic program works, add enhancements incrementally.

4. **Collaborate Using Git:**  
   - Ensure all team members are pushing and pulling changes regularly.

---

## **8. Test and Debug**

- **Test Core Features:**  
  - Does the program handle all required inputs and outputs?  
  - Are loops and conditionals functioning as expected?

- **Check Edge Cases:**  
  - Test scenarios with invalid input or extreme data values.

- **Fix Bugs:**  
  - Use print statements or a debugger to trace errors.  
  - Test frequently to avoid building on broken code.

---

## **9. Document the Project**

- **Comment Your Code:**  
  - Explain why each part of the code exists, especially complex logic.

- **Write the README File:**  
  - Include a clear overview, features, instructions, and team contributions.

- **Prepare the Presentation:**  
  - Highlight the purpose of your program, its functionality, and what your team learned.
