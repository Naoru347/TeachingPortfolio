# Guide to Writing an Effective README.md (Java Edition)

## **What is a README.md?**
A `README.md` is a document that explains the purpose, features, and usage of your Java project. Itâ€™s often the first thing someone sees when encountering your work, so it should be clear, concise, and informative.

Your README serves as a user guide for your project, helping others (and your future self!) understand how to use it and what makes it valuable.
