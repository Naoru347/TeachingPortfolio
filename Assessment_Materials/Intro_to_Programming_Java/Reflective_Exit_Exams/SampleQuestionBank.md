# Oral Assessment Questions - Intro to Java Programming

**Instructions:**  
- During the oral assessment, each student will be asked approximately 3–5 questions from the list below.  
- The assessment will last about 15 minutes per student.  
- Questions will be chosen to gauge students' understanding of core concepts, their ability to think critically, and their communication skills.  
- Assessment criteria will include:  
  - Depth of conceptual understanding  
  - Ability to apply knowledge to new or slightly altered problems  
  - Clarity and coherence of explanations  
  - Demonstration of critical thinking and problem-solving strategies

## Core Programming Concepts

### Variables and Data Types
- Explain what a variable is and how it’s used in a Java program.  
- How do you decide whether to use an `int`, `double`, `String`, or another data type?

### Operators and Expressions
- What’s the difference between the assignment operator (`=`) and the equality operator (`==`) in Java?  
- Give an example of using arithmetic operators to calculate and store a value in Java.

### Input and Output
- How would you read user input using the `Scanner` class in Java?  
- Why is it important to format output in a user-friendly way using `System.out.println()` or `printf()`?

### Conditional Statements
- Describe how an `if` statement works in Java and give an example.  
- What’s the difference between using multiple `if` statements versus using `if…else if…else` chains?

### Boolean Logic
- How do logical operators like `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT) work in Java decision-making?  
- Walk me through a scenario where you’d need to combine multiple conditions.

### Loops and Iteration
- Explain the difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop in Java.  
- When might you choose a `do-while` loop instead?

### Loop Applications
- Describe a situation where you’d use a loop to process an array or list.  
- How would you use a `break` or `continue` statement to control loop execution?

## Methods and Modularity

### Defining and Calling Methods
- What is a method in Java, and why do we use them?  
- Explain the difference between defining a method and calling a method.

### Parameters and Return Values
- How do parameters help make methods more flexible in Java?  
- What’s the difference between a `void` method and one that returns a value?

### Scope of Variables
- What does variable scope mean in Java, and why does it matter?  
- What happens if you try to access a local variable outside its method?

## Data Structures and String Manipulation

### Arrays and ArrayLists
- What is an array in Java, and how do you access individual elements?  
- How is an `ArrayList` different from a regular array?

### Strings
- How is a `String` different from primitive data types?  
- Give an example of manipulating a string using Java methods like `substring()` or `equals()`.

## Debugging, Testing, and Best Practices

### Error Handling and Debugging
- How do you approach debugging when your Java program doesn’t behave as expected?  
- Give an example of a common error (like an off-by-one error or `NullPointerException`) and how you’d fix it.

### Testing and Validation
- Why is testing your code important, and when should you do it?  
- What are some simple ways to test and validate the correctness of a Java program?

### Comments and Code Clarity
- Why are comments useful in Java, and how should you use them effectively?  
- How would you write code that is easy for others to read and maintain?

### Modularity and Reusability
- Why is it helpful to break your Java code into reusable methods or classes?  
- Describe a time when modularizing your code saved time or effort.

## Problem-Solving and Algorithms

### Algorithmic Thinking
- How do you break down a complex problem into smaller tasks before coding in Java?  
- Describe how you’d solve a basic problem like finding the largest number in an array.

### Efficiency Considerations
- Why does algorithmic efficiency matter in programming?  
- Give an example of optimizing a program to improve performance.

### Incremental Development
- Why is it beneficial to develop and test your Java program in small steps?  
- Share an example of a project where you built a solution gradually.

## Final Project-Specific Questions

### File I/O and Persistence
- Why is it important to store data persistently?  
- How would you read from or write to a file in Java using `FileReader`, `Scanner`, or `BufferedWriter`?  
- How can you ensure your program handles missing or corrupt files gracefully?

### Data Processing and Validation
- How would you filter or search through data based on user input in Java?  
- Why is input validation important, and how would you implement it?  
- Explain how sorting works and describe how you would implement or use `Arrays.sort()` or `Collections.sort()`.

### Algorithms and Simulation (Optional)
- What is an algorithm, and why is it important in programming?  
- How would you explain a search algorithm like linear search or binary search?  
- How can simulation be useful for modeling real-world systems in Java?

### Security and Robustness
- Why is it risky to assume input will always be correct?  
- How would you use `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions in Java?  
- What practices help make a Java program more secure and reliable?

### Documentation and Reflection
- Why is a README file important for a programming project?  
- What should be included in a Java project’s README file to make it useful for other developers?  
- How does your final project demonstrate your understanding of Java fundamentals?

## Personal Reflection and Learning

### Reflection and Learning Outcomes
- How has learning Java changed the way you think about solving problems?  
- What was the most challenging concept or assignment in this course, and how did you handle it?  
- What advice would you give yourself or future students about approaching programming for the first time?
