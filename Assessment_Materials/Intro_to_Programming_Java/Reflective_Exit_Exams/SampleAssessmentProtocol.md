# Holistic Scoring Guide for Oral Assessment (15% of Final Grade)

**Overview:**  
This oral assessment will be evaluated holistically. Rather than breaking down performance into separate categories, we will consider your overall demonstration of understanding, critical thinking, clarity of communication, and engagement as one integrated performance. Your final score will reflect how well you convey a comprehensive grasp of core programming and software development concepts, your ability to reason through problems or questions, and how effectively you communicate and engage in the discussion.

Note that if any issues have arisen during the semester (e.g., academic integrity violations, attendance/participation issues, late work, etc.), students will be asked up to two questions about those issues and their impacts on their learning. Students can still receive full marks on these questions, but the assessment will focus instead on the reflective quality of their responses and their future planning to prevent or mitigate such issues in the future so they can be successful learners. 

**Total Weight:** 15% of the final course grade.

## Holistic Performance Levels

**14–15 Points (Exceptional Performance)**  
The student demonstrates an outstanding command of core Java programming concepts and object-oriented principles, articulating explanations with depth, precision, and insight. Responses show critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and a clear ability to apply concepts (e.g., classes, inheritance, exception handling, algorithms) to new scenarios. Communication is confident, coherent, and accessible, and the student remains fully engaged, responding thoughtfully to any follow-up questions. The performance indicates strong preparedness for more advanced coursework or real-world development.

**11–13 Points (Strong Performance)**  
The student shows a solid, well-rounded understanding of key Java concepts and software design practices, providing accurate and reasonably detailed explanations. Their critical thinking is apparent, and they handle slightly altered or unfamiliar problems effectively. Communication is generally clear and logical, with only occasional moments of hesitation. The student engages respectfully and professionally, displaying readiness for further study or entry-level development roles.

**8–10 Points (Competent Performance)**  
The student demonstrates a basic grasp of core programming concepts (such as control structures, data types, and class design), explaining them with some clarity and detail. Critical thinking and problem-solving are evident in familiar contexts, though responses may lack depth or nuance. Communication is understandable but may be uneven, and engagement is steady but limited. The performance suggests a functional understanding that would benefit from further practice and refinement.

**5–7 Points (Developing Performance)**  
The student’s understanding of core Java concepts is partial or inconsistent. Explanations may be vague or rely on rote memorization rather than comprehension. Problem-solving is tentative and often misses key details. Communication may be disjointed or unclear at times, and the student requires prompting to engage in discussion. This level of performance indicates the need for additional support and review to achieve mastery.

**0–4 Points (Insufficient Performance)**  
The student demonstrates minimal understanding of Java or related programming concepts. Attempts to explain topics or answer questions are inaccurate, incomplete, or absent. Communication is often unclear, and engagement is minimal. This performance suggests a significant gap in understanding and a need for focused remediation and academic support.

**Note:**  
This holistic approach integrates conceptual mastery, reasoning skills, clarity of expression, and professional engagement into one overall judgment. The final score reflects a comprehensive impression of the student’s readiness, depth of learning, and ability to articulate and apply knowledge in a meaningful way.
