# Final Project Assignment: Portfolio-Worthy Python Application

## Assignment Overview

The final project is your opportunity to apply what you’ve learned in this course by building a Python program with real-world relevance. To help guide you, we’ve provided starter code for three project options tailored to potential career paths: **Data Science**, **Computer Science and Engineering**, and **Cybersecurity**. You’ll implement core functionality, enhance the code with your ideas, and document your work to produce a polished project suitable for your portfolio.

## Project Options

### 1. Data Science: Data Analysis and Visualization Tool

**Starter Code:**  
The provided code will load a CSV file and display its contents in the terminal. The CSV file will include a simple dataset, such as weather data or sales figures. Basic functionality for reading the file and printing its contents is already implemented.

**Your Tasks:**
- **Enhance Data Processing:**  
  Add at least two of the following features:
  - Filter data by specific criteria (e.g., date range, category, or value threshold).
  - Sort data by column (e.g., ascending or descending order).
  - Perform aggregation, such as calculating averages, totals, or counts.

- **Create Visualizations:**  
  Use `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or another Python library to generate at least two visualizations, such as:
  - Bar charts to compare categorical data.
  - Line charts for trends over time.
  - Scatter plots to identify relationships between variables.

- **Interactive Command-Line Input:**  
  Allow users to:
  - Select which dataset they want to analyze (if multiple datasets are available).
  - Choose a visualization type or filter criteria interactively through prompts.

### 2. Computer Science and Engineering: Simulation or Algorithm Implementation

**Starter Code:**  
The provided code will include a template for simulating a simple real-world scenario, such as a traffic light system or basic graph for pathfinding. The starter code will have basic structure definitions, such as initializing states for traffic lights or creating nodes and edges for a graph.

**Your Tasks:**
- **Implement Core Functionality:**  
  Depending on the scenario:
  - For a traffic light simulation: Implement functionality to simulate light changes over time (e.g., red, yellow, green cycles).
  - For a graph-based simulation: Implement an algorithm like breadth-first search (BFS) or Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate paths.

- **Add Customizable Features:**  
  Enhance the simulation with one or more of the following:
  - Allow users to input custom parameters, such as:
    - Traffic light timings or the number of intersections.
    - Graph size, weights, or start and end nodes for pathfinding.
  - Add real-time or step-by-step visualization of the simulation using `turtle` or `matplotlib`.

- **Generate Output:**  
  Create a clear output for your simulation, such as:
  - A log file showing the states or steps of the simulation.
  - Visual representation of the results (e.g., graph paths or traffic flow).

### 3. Cybersecurity: Secure Login and Encryption System

**Starter Code:**  
The provided code will include a basic login system where usernames and passwords are stored in plaintext. Users can log in if their credentials match the stored values. Basic functionality for adding new users may also be included.

**Your Tasks:**
- **Implement Secure Password Storage:**  
  Replace plaintext password storage with secure hashing using a library like `bcrypt` or `hashlib`.

- **Enhance System Features:**  
  Add at least two of the following:
  - A feature for account creation, allowing new users to register.
  - A password recovery mechanism (e.g., security question or email simulation).
  - Multi-factor authentication, such as requiring a second step (e.g., a PIN or security question).

- **Improve Error Handling:**  
  Ensure robust error handling for:
  - Invalid or missing inputs.
  - Attempts to log in with incorrect credentials.
  - Handling edge cases, such as duplicate usernames or empty passwords.

- **Secure Data Storage:**  
  Store user data securely in a file or database. If using files, ensure they are properly formatted (e.g., JSON or encrypted).

   - **Reflection:** A short note on how this project connects to your career goals.

3. **Reflection Paper (1 Page):**
   - Why you chose your project option.
   - What challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
   - What you learned from the project and how it connects to your future goals.

4. **Presentation (Optional Bonus):**
