# **Lab 8: Midterm Project Kickoff and Team Collaboration (Java Edition)**

---

## **Objectives**
1. Form project teams and establish clear team roles.
2. Collaboratively brainstorm and outline a Java project plan.
3. Practice pseudocode problem-solving as a team.
4. Create a timeline and establish workflows for successful collaboration.

---

## **Scenario**
Your midterm project requires teamwork to build an **Interactive Console-Based Java Application** that demonstrates your programming skills. In this lab, youâ€™ll focus on organizing your team, setting goals, and planning workflows to ensure a smooth development process.

## **Instructions**

### **Part 1: Team Formation and Role Assignment** (15 minutes)
1. **Form Teams**:
   - Teams of 3-4 students.
   - Introduce yourselves and share strengths (e.g., Java coding, debugging, documenting, creative design).

2. **Assign Roles**:
   - **Team Lead**: Oversees the timeline and coordinates team meetings.
   - **Lead Developer**: Focuses on building the core Java functionality.
   - **Tester/Debugger**: Ensures correctness and performance of the Java code.
   - **Documentarian**: Writes the README, Javadoc comments, and other documentation.

3. **Document Team Info**:
   - Create a shared Google Doc or `.txt` file.
   - Include names, roles, and contact details.

---

### **Part 2: Project Planning and Brainstorming** (25 minutes)
1. **Choose a Project Theme**:
   - **Text-Based Game**: Interactive story using `Scanner` and `switch` or `if-else` logic.
   - **Utility Tool**: Simple Java utility such as a to-do list or calculator.
   - **Data Explorer**: Java program that reads `.csv` or `.txt` files and analyzes data.

2. **Brainstorm Features**:
   - List must-have core features and optional enhancements.
   - Use a shared document to track ideas.

3. **Outline a Project Plan**:
   - Write pseudocode for core functionality.
   - Sketch out program flow using input/output, loops, and conditionals.

4. **Timeline**:
   - Set weekly goals and assign specific tasks.
   - Use the midterm project prompt for guidance.

---

### **Part 3: Pseudocode Challenge** (20 minutes)
1. **Scenario-Based Task**:
   - Pick a small piece of your app and write pseudocode as a team.

   **Examples:**
   - *Game*: Branching decision using `Scanner` input.
   - *Utility*: Add and remove items from an `ArrayList`.
   - *Data Tool*: Read and parse lines from a file.

2. **Teamwork**:
   - Use Java-style pseudocode.
   - Write it out together, refine it, and include it in your shared document.

---

### **Part 4: Presentation and Workflow Setup** (15 minutes)
1. **Mini-Pitch** (2 minutes):
   - Describe your project and its purpose.
   - Mention core features and team roles.

2. **Setup GitHub Workflow**:
   - Create a GitHub repository for your team.
   - Add all team members as collaborators.
   - Create a directory structure like:
     ```
     /src
     /docs
     README.md
     ```
   - Make an initial commit with project goals and team info in the README.

3. **Submit Your Work**:
   - Submit your shared document (roles, plan, pseudocode, timeline) to the LMS.
   - Include your GitHub repo link.

---

## **Submission Instructions**
1. Submit the following:
   - Shared team planning document (Google Doc or text file).
   - Link to your GitHub repository.
2. Ensure your README includes:
   - Project title and description.
   - Team member names and roles.
   - Project timeline and weekly goals.

## **Hints and Tips**

### **For Brainstorming**
- Prioritize simplicity for core features.
- Think about what Java concepts you want to demonstrate (e.g., OOP, arrays, file I/O).

### **For Pseudocode**
- Use comments and indentation like:
  ```java
  // Display welcome message
  // Prompt user for input
  if (choice.equals("option1")) {
      // Execute logic for option1
  } else {
      // Handle other cases
  }
  ```

### **For GitHub**
- Commit early and often.
- Use branches if working on different features.
- Assign issues or tasks to team members to avoid merge conflicts.
