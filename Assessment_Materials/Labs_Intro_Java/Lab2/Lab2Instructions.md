# **Lab 2: Basic Calculations Program (Java Edition)**

## **Objectives**
1. Work with variables and basic data types in Java.
2. Perform arithmetic and string operations.
3. Learn to handle errors using `try-catch` exception handling.

---

## **Instructions**

### **Part 1: Setting Up Your Environment**
1. Open your programming environment (VS Code or IntelliJ).
2. Create a new Java file named `BasicCalculations.java`.

---

### **Part 2: Program Requirements**

#### **Task 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations**
1. Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
    - Use a `Scanner` object to accept user input and `Double.parseDouble()` to convert input to a numeric type.
      ```java
      Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
      double num1 = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());
      System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
      double num2 = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());
      ```

2. Perform the following operations:
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division

3. Print the results clearly, for example:
    ```
    The sum of 5 and 3 is 8.0
    The difference between 5 and 3 is 2.0
    The product of 5 and 3 is 15.0
    The quotient of 5 and 3 is 1.67
    ```

#### **Task 2: String Operations**
1. Prompt the user to enter two strings:
    ```java
    System.out.print("Enter the first string: ");
    String str1 = scanner.nextLine();
    System.out.print("Enter the second string: ");
    String str2 = scanner.nextLine();
    ```

2. Concatenate the two strings and display the result:
    ```
    Concatenated string: HelloWorld
    ```

3. Print the length of each string individually:
    ```
    Length of first string: 5
    Length of second string: 5
    ```

#### **Task 3: Error Handling for Division by Zero**
1. Add error handling to ensure the program doesnâ€™t crash when attempting division by zero:
    - Use a `try-catch` block:
      ```java
      try {
          double division = num1 / num2;
          System.out.println("The quotient of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + division);
      } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
          System.out.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.");
      }
      ```

---

### **Part 3: Code Formatting and Documentation**
1. Include comments in your code to explain what each section does.
    - Example:
      ```java
      // Prompt the user for two numbers
      ```

2. Use meaningful variable names that describe their purpose.

---

### **Part 4: Testing Your Program**
1. Test your program with the following scenarios:
    - Two positive numbers (e.g., 5 and 3).
    - A positive and a negative number (e.g., 7 and -2).
    - Division by zero (e.g., 4 and 0).
    - Two strings of varying lengths (e.g., "Hello" and "World").

---

### **Part 5: Submitting Your Work**
1. Save your completed Java file as `BasicCalculations.java`.
2. Submit your file to the GitHub Classroom repository for this lab.

---

### **Lab Report Reminder**
After completing the lab, write a 1-page lab report using the provided template. Be sure to:
- Summarize what you accomplished.
- Highlight challenges and how you resolved them.
- Explain how this knowledge might be useful in your midterm or final project.

Lab reports should also be submitted to the GitHub Classroom repository as `lab2_report.md`.
