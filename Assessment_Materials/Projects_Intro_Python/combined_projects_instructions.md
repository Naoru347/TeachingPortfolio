# Shorter Projects Instructions

All projects will be submitted via your GitHub Classroom repository. Follow the submission guidelines for each project, and ensure your repository is organized and includes meaningful commit messages. Below are the instructions for the five shorter projects in this course.

---

## **Project 1: Calculator Application**
**Due:** Week 3  
**Topics Covered:** Variables, Data Types, and Basic Operations  

### **Objective:**
Create a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

### **Requirements:**
1. **Input and Output:**
   - Accept two numbers and an operation (e.g., +, -, *, /) from the user.
   - Display the result of the calculation.

2. **Features:**
   - Handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., division by zero or non-numeric inputs).
   - Allow the user to perform multiple calculations in a single session.

3. **Enhancements (Optional):**
   - Add additional operations like modulus or exponentiation.
   - Include a menu to let users choose operations interactively.

### **Submission:**
Submit your program to your GitHub repository with the following:
- **Code:** Python file with clear comments explaining each part of the code.
- **Commit Messages:** Include descriptive commit messages for each change made.

## **Project 2: Pattern Generation**
**Due:** Week 5  
**Topics Covered:** Control Flow (Loops)  

### **Objective:**
Develop a program that generates a variety of patterns based on user input.

### **Requirements:**
1. **Patterns:**
   - Implement at least three different patterns (e.g., pyramids, diamonds, or grids).
   - Allow users to choose the pattern type and size.

2. **Loops:**
   - Use nested loops to construct patterns.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Ensure valid inputs (e.g., numeric input for size).

### **Enhancements (Optional):**
   - Add color to the patterns using ASCII characters.
   - Create an option to save the pattern to a text file.

### **Submission:**
Submit your program to your GitHub repository with the following:
- **Code:** Python file with meaningful comments.
- **README:** A short description of the patterns implemented.
- **Commit Messages:** Document changes incrementally.

## **Project 3: Temperature Converter Library**
**Due:** Week 7  
**Topics Covered:** Functions, Modular Programming  

### **Objective:**
Build a library of functions to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

### **Requirements:**
1. **Functions:**
   - Create individual functions for each type of conversion (e.g., `celsius_to_fahrenheit`, `fahrenheit_to_kelvin`).
   - Use parameters and return values effectively.

2. **User Interaction:**
   - Provide a menu-based interface for the user to choose conversions.

3. **Modularity:**
   - Organize the functions in a separate Python file and import them into a main script.

### **Enhancements (Optional):**
   - Add an option to handle bulk conversions using a list of temperatures.
   - Include unit testing for the functions.

### **Submission:**
Submit your program to your GitHub repository with the following:
- **Code:** Library file and main script.
- **README:** Explain how to use the library.
- **Commit Messages:** Track progress with detailed commit messages.

## **Project 4: Data Processing Application**
**Due:** Week 12  
**Topics Covered:** File Operations, Debugging  

### **Objective:**
Develop a program to read data from a file, process it, and generate meaningful output.

### **Requirements:**
1. **File Operations:**
   - Read input data from a CSV or text file.
   - Allow the user to specify the file location.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Perform basic operations such as sorting, filtering, or aggregating data.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle file-related errors (e.g., file not found, incorrect format).

### **Enhancements (Optional):**
   - Add a feature to write the processed data to a new file.
   - Include summary statistics (e.g., averages, counts).

### **Submission:**
Submit your program to your GitHub repository with the following:
- **Code:** Python script and a sample data file.
- **README:** Include setup instructions and program usage.
- **Commit Messages:** Include detailed descriptions for all updates.

## **Project 5: Simple Class Implementation**
**Due:** Week 14  
**Topics Covered:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  

### **Objective:**
Create a simple program using classes to model a real-world object.

### **Requirements:**
1. **Class Definition:**
   - Define a class with attributes (e.g., `name`, `price`, `quantity` for a product).
   - Include methods to manipulate the attributes (e.g., `restock`, `sell`).

2. **Objects:**
   - Instantiate multiple objects and demonstrate their behavior through method calls.

3. **File Integration:**
   - Allow saving and loading object data to/from a file.

### **Enhancements (Optional):**
   - Add inheritance to create specialized classes (e.g., `PerishableProduct` inheriting from `Product`).
   - Include validation for attributes (e.g., `quantity` cannot be negative).

### **Submission:**
Submit your program to your GitHub repository with the following:
- **Code:** Python program file with comments.
- **README:** Include explanations for the class and its methods.
- **Commit Messages:** Clearly document your progress.

## **General Submission Guidelines**
1. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Each project should have its own subdirectory within your repository.
   - Include all relevant files (e.g., code, README, sample data).

2. **Commit Messages:**
   - Use meaningful and incremental commit messages (e.g., "Implemented temperature conversion functions").

3. **Deadlines:**
   - Projects are due at 11:59 PM on the specified week. Late submissions will incur penalties as outlined in the syllabus.

4. **Professionalism:**
   - Ensure your repository is clean and well-organized before submission.
