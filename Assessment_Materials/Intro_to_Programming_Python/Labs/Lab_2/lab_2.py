# lab_2.py: A simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic and string operations.

# Global variables (optional for storing inputs)
# NOTE: These are optional. Use them only if you're comfortable with global variables.
number1 = 0
number2 = 0
string1 = ""
string2 = ""

def main():
    global number1, number2, string1, string2  # Access global variables
    
    # TODO: Get two numbers from the user as input
    # Use Python's input() and convert to appropriate data types (int/float)
    # Store the inputs in global variables or local variables, depending on your approach.

    # TODO: Perform basic arithmetic operations
    # Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
    # Make sure to handle division by zero gracefully

    # TODO: Print the results of the calculations
    # Clearly label each result (e.g., "Addition result: ...")

    # TODO: Get two strings from the user as input
    # Store these in string1 and string2 (or as local variables if you prefer)

    # TODO: Concatenate the strings and print the result
    # TODO: Print the length of each string
    # Use Python's len() function

    # TEMPORARILY!
    # DELETE THE FOLLOWING LINE OF CODE WHEN YOU FINISH THE LAB
    print("Complete all TODOs to finish Lab 2!")
