# Unified Rubric for Shorter Projects

This rubric will be used to assess any of the five shorter projects. Each project will be graded based on four main categories, with a focus on functionality, code quality, documentation, and professionalism.

## **Grading Criteria**

### **1. Core Functionality (40%)**
- **4 (Excellent):**
  - The program meets all specified requirements.
  - All core functionality is fully implemented and works as intended.
  - Program handles edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully.
- **3 (Good):**
  - The program meets most requirements, with minor issues.
  - Core functionality is implemented but may contain some bugs.
  - Limited handling of edge cases or invalid inputs.
- **2 (Satisfactory):**
  - The program meets some requirements but is incomplete.
  - Core functionality has significant bugs or gaps.
  - Little or no handling of edge cases or invalid inputs.
- **1 (Needs Improvement):**
  - The program meets few or none of the requirements.
  - Core functionality is mostly missing or non-functional.

### **2. Code Quality (30%)**
- **4 (Excellent):**
  - Code is clean, well-organized, and follows Python best practices.
  - Meaningful variable names and comments are used throughout.
  - Proper use of functions, modularity, and reusable components.
- **3 (Good):**
  - Code is mostly clean and organized, with minor issues.
  - Some variable names or comments could be improved.
  - Functions are used, but modularity could be enhanced.
- **2 (Satisfactory):**
  - Code is functional but lacks structure or clarity.
  - Inconsistent use of meaningful variable names or comments.
  - Functions are underutilized or poorly structured.
- **1 (Needs Improvement):**
  - Code is difficult to read and poorly organized.
  - No meaningful comments or variable names.
  - Little or no use of functions or modular programming principles.

### **3. Documentation (20%)**
- **4 (Excellent):**
  - README file is comprehensive and professional.
  - Includes a clear project description, instructions for running the program, and details about features implemented.
  - Code comments effectively explain logic and purpose.
- **3 (Good):**
  - README file is complete but could be more detailed.
  - Instructions are mostly clear, but minor improvements are needed.
  - Code comments are present but could explain more complex logic.
- **2 (Satisfactory):**
  - README file is incomplete or unclear.
  - Instructions for running the program are missing or confusing.
  - Minimal or ineffective use of code comments.
- **1 (Needs Improvement):**
  - README file is missing or severely lacking.
  - No instructions for running the program.
  - Code comments are absent or unhelpful.

### **4. Professionalism and Workflow (10%)**
- **4 (Excellent):**
  - Program is submitted on time, with a well-organized repository structure.
  - Frequent and meaningful Git commits demonstrate progress and iterative development.
  - Repository is free from unnecessary or extraneous files.
- **3 (Good):**
  - Program is submitted on time, but repository structure could be improved.
  - Git commits are somewhat frequent, but commit messages could be clearer.
  - Some unnecessary files are included in the repository.
- **2 (Satisfactory):**
  - Program is late or repository is poorly organized.
  - Few Git commits, or commit messages are unclear or missing.
  - Many unnecessary files are present in the repository.
- **1 (Needs Improvement):**
  - Program is late and repository is disorganized.
  - Minimal or no Git usage.
  - Repository contains excessive unnecessary files.
