# Holistic Scoring Guide for Oral Assessment (15% of Final Grade)

**Overview:**  
This oral assessment will be evaluated holistically. Rather than breaking down performance into separate categories, we will consider your overall demonstration of understanding, critical thinking, clarity of communication, and engagement as one integrated performance. Your final score will reflect how well you convey a comprehensive grasp of core programming concepts, your ability to reason through problems or questions, and how effectively you communicate and engage in the discussion.

Note that if any issues have arisen during the semester (e.g., academic integrity violations, attendance/participation issues, late work, etc.) students will be asked up two questions about those issues and their impacts on their learning. Students can still receive full marks on these quesions, but the assessment will focus instead on the reflective quality of their responses and their future planning to prevent/mitigate such issues in the  future so that they can be successful learners. 

**Total Weight:** 15% of the final course grade.

## Holistic Performance Levels

**14–15 Points (Exceptional Performance)**  
The student demonstrates an outstanding command of course concepts, articulating explanations with depth, precision, and insight. Responses show critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and a clear ability to apply concepts to new situations. Communication is confident, coherent, and accessible, and the student remains fully engaged, responding thoughtfully to any follow-up questions or prompts. Overall, the student’s performance indicates strong preparedness for more advanced work in the field.

**11–13 Points (Strong Performance)**  
The student shows a solid, well-rounded understanding of most key concepts, providing accurate and reasonably detailed explanations. Their critical thinking is apparent, though not always fully explored, and they handle common or slightly altered problems effectively. Communication is generally clear and logical, with only occasional moments of hesitation or imprecision. The student engages respectfully and professionally, displaying readiness for further development and study.

**8–10 Points (Competent Performance)**  
The student demonstrates an acceptable grasp of core concepts, explaining them with basic clarity and some supporting detail. Critical thinking and problem-solving may be limited to more familiar contexts, and while the student responds adequately, their reasoning might be somewhat superficial or lack depth. Communication is understandable but may be uneven, and engagement is polite though not particularly dynamic. The performance indicates a foundational understanding that can be built upon with further practice.

**5–7 Points (Developing Performance)**  
The student’s understanding of core concepts is partial or inconsistent. Explanations may be vague, incomplete, or rely on memorization rather than genuine comprehension. Problem-solving is tentative and often misses important nuances. Communication may be unfocused or unclear at times, and engagement is minimal or overly reliant on prompting. The overall performance suggests that significant additional study and practice are needed.

**0–4 Points (Insufficient Performance)**  
The student’s responses demonstrate minimal understanding of the material. Attempts to explain concepts or solve problems are inaccurate, overly simplistic, or absent. Communication is often unclear or confusing, and the student shows little meaningful engagement in the assessment. This level of performance indicates a critical need for remediation and increased support.

**Note:**  
This holistic approach integrates conceptual mastery, reasoning skills, clarity of expression, and professional engagement into one overall judgment. The final score reflects a comprehensive impression of the student’s readiness, depth of learning, and ability to articulate and apply knowledge in a meaningful way.
