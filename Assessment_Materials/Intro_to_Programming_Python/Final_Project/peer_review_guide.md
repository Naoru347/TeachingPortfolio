# Peer Review Guide: Final Project

## **Purpose of Peer Review**
Peer review is an opportunity to get feedback from your classmates to improve your project. It helps you identify areas for refinement while also allowing you to see different approaches to solving similar problems. Use this guide to structure your feedback and provide constructive, actionable suggestions.

---

## **Activity Overview**
In your group of 3-4 students:
1. Each group member will take turns presenting their project.
2. Group members will provide feedback based on the criteria outlined below.
3. You will leave with a clear plan for next steps to improve your project.

---

## **Steps for Peer Review**

### **1. Presentation (5 minutes per student)**
For your presentation, explain:
- Your chosen project option (Data Science, Computer Science & Engineering, or Cybersecurity).
- The core functionality you’ve implemented.
- Any enhancements you’ve added.
- One part of your project you are proud of.
- One part of your project you’re unsure about or would like feedback on.

### **2. Guided Group Feedback (10 minutes per project)**
Group members will discuss and provide feedback based on the following categories:

#### **A. Usability**
- Is the program intuitive and easy to use?
- Are user inputs and outputs clear?
- Are error messages helpful and informative?

#### **B. Functionality**
- Does the program run without errors?
- Are the core features fully implemented?
- Do the additional features (enhancements) add value to the program?

#### **C. Design and Clarity**
- For Data Science projects: Are the visualizations clear, accurate, and engaging?
- For Simulations/Algorithms: Are the outputs or visual representations easy to understand?
- For Cybersecurity: Are the security features robust and user-friendly?

#### **D. Code Quality**
- Is the code organized and easy to read?
- Are comments and documentation helpful?
- Are there any areas where the code could be optimized?

#### **E. Documentation**
- Does the README file clearly explain the project and its features?
- Are instructions for running the program easy to follow?
- Is there a clear explanation of how the project connects to career goals?

### **3. Written Feedback**
Each group member will write down feedback for the presenter. Use the following structure:
- **Strengths:** List 2-3 things the presenter did well.
- **Suggestions:** List 2-3 specific ways the project could be improved.
- **Questions:** Ask 1-2 questions to help the presenter think critically about their project.

---

## **Guidelines for Constructive Feedback**
- Be specific: Instead of saying, “The code could be better,” suggest a specific area, such as, “Consider adding comments to the function that processes user input.”
- Be respectful: Remember, this is a collaborative learning experience.
- Be supportive: Highlight strengths as well as areas for improvement.

---

## **Post-Review Reflection**
After the peer review session, take 5-10 minutes to reflect on the feedback you received:
- Summarize the key points of feedback.
- Identify 1-2 actionable steps you’ll take to improve your project.
- Consider discussing unresolved questions with your instructor or during office hours.

---

## **Deliverables**
1. Written feedback for each group member (to be shared with them at the end of the session).
2. A summary of feedback you received (for your own use).
3. Revised plans for improving your project before the next milestone (to be submitted to the course LMS by DATE).

Let’s make this peer review session as helpful and constructive as possible!
