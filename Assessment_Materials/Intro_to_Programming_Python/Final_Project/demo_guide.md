## **How to Prepare**

### **Step 1: Plan Your Demo**
1. **Decide What to Show:**
   - Focus on your program’s **core functionality** and **enhancements**.
   - Highlight features you’re most proud of.
   - Choose a clear and simple example to demonstrate (e.g., a dataset for visualizations or a specific scenario for a simulation).

2. **Prepare a Flow:**
   - Write a brief outline of what you’ll say during each part of the demo.
   - Practice transitioning smoothly between sections (e.g., from introduction to demonstration).

3. **Identify Key Points:**
   - Explain your project’s purpose and how it aligns with the course and your career goals.
   - Share one challenge you faced and how you solved it.
   - Discuss what you learned from the project.

### **Step 2: Test Your Program**
1. **Run Your Code:**
   - Make sure your program works as intended before the demo.
   - Test for edge cases or common user errors.
   - Practice using sample inputs or scenarios to show meaningful outputs.

2. **Handle Unexpected Errors:**
   - Be prepared for things to go wrong. If your program crashes, explain what happened and how you’re working to fix it.
   - Create backup screenshots or videos as a fallback option.

---

### **Step 3: Practice Your Presentation**
1. **Speak Clearly:**
   - Practice explaining your project to someone unfamiliar with programming.
   - Avoid jargon or overly technical terms unless you explain them.

2. **Practice Transitions:**
   - Rehearse moving between explaining, demonstrating, and reflecting.
   - Practice timing your demo to stay within 10 minutes.

3. **Anticipate Questions:**
   - Think about what classmates or the instructor might ask.
   - Prepare brief answers to explain your design decisions or challenges.

## **Tips for an Effective Demo**
- **Use a Clear Setup:**
   - Make sure your screen is visible to the class.
   - Use a clean, organized workspace to avoid distractions (e.g., close unnecessary tabs or windows).

- **Focus on Key Features:**
   - Don’t try to show everything. Stick to the features that best represent your work.

- **Narrate Your Actions:**
   - Explain what you’re doing as you run your program. For example: “I’ll now input a dataset to show how the program filters data by date.”

- **Be Honest About Challenges:**
   - It’s okay to acknowledge features that didn’t work or areas for improvement. This shows growth and learning.

- **Highlight Career Connections:**
   - Explain how the skills you used or learned in this project will help you in your future career.
