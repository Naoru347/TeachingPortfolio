# Final Project Grading Rubric

## **Overview**
This rubric will be used to evaluate your final project based on five key categories: **Core Functionality**, **Enhancements**, **Documentation**, **Reflection**, and **Code Quality**. Each category has specific criteria, and the weight for each category reflects its importance in the overall evaluation.

---

## **Grading Criteria**

### **1. Core Functionality (40%)**
#### **Criteria:**
- [ ] Required features in the starter code are fully implemented and functional.
- [ ] The program runs without errors or crashes.
- [ ] The core features meet the requirements specified in the project prompt.
- [ ] The program handles edge cases effectively (e.g., invalid inputs, empty datasets).

| **Performance Level** | **Description**                                                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Excellent (36-40)** | All required features are implemented flawlessly. Program is robust and handles edge cases effectively. |
| **Good (30-35)**      | Most required features are implemented with minor issues. Handles most edge cases. |
| **Satisfactory (24-29)** | Some required features are implemented, but there are noticeable issues or missing functionality. |
| **Needs Improvement (0-23)** | Required features are incomplete or fail to function correctly. Minimal handling of edge cases. |

---

### **2. Enhancements (20%)**
#### **Criteria:**
- [ ] Enhancements are meaningful and improve the functionality or user experience of the project.
- [ ] Additional features demonstrate creativity and technical effort.
- [ ] Enhancements are well-integrated into the program without breaking core functionality.

| **Performance Level** | **Description**                                                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Excellent (18-20)** | Enhancements are innovative, well-executed, and significantly improve the project. |
| **Good (15-17)**      | Enhancements are meaningful and mostly functional, with minor issues. |
| **Satisfactory (12-14)** | Enhancements are basic or have noticeable issues but add some value to the project. |
| **Needs Improvement (0-11)** | Enhancements are minimal, non-functional, or poorly integrated. |

---

### **3. Documentation (20%)**
#### **Criteria:**
- [ ] README file is clear, professional, and easy to follow.
- [ ] Includes all required sections: Title, Description, Features, Installation, Usage, Reflection, License (optional), and Acknowledgments (optional).
- [ ] Comments in the code explain the purpose and logic of key sections.
- [ ] Project directory is organized logically (e.g., separating code, data, and documentation files).

| **Performance Level** | **Description**                                                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Excellent (18-20)** | README and comments are detailed, clear, and professional. Directory is highly organized. |
| **Good (15-17)**      | README and comments are clear and include most required sections. Directory is organized. |
| **Satisfactory (12-14)** | README and comments are basic but functional, with missing sections or limited detail. Directory is somewhat organized. |
| **Needs Improvement (0-11)** | README and comments are incomplete, unclear, or missing. Directory is disorganized. |

### **4. Reflection (10%)**
#### **Criteria:**
- [ ] Reflection thoughtfully analyzes challenges faced and how they were overcome.
- [ ] Clearly connects learning outcomes to career goals.
- [ ] Demonstrates personal growth and insights gained from the project.

| **Performance Level** | **Description**                                                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Excellent (9-10)**  | Reflection is insightful, detailed, and makes strong connections to career goals. |
| **Good (7-8)**        | Reflection is clear and connects challenges, learning, and goals with minor omissions. |
| **Satisfactory (6)**  | Reflection is basic and touches on challenges or learning but lacks depth. |
| **Needs Improvement (0-5)** | Reflection is minimal or missing, with little to no connection to challenges or goals. |

---

### **5. Code Quality (10%)**
#### **Criteria:**
- [ ] Code is readable and follows Python best practices (e.g., PEP 8).
- [ ] Code is modular, with functions and classes used appropriately.
- [ ] Proper error handling is implemented (e.g., try/except blocks).
- [ ] Code avoids redundancy and uses efficient algorithms where applicable.

| **Performance Level** | **Description**                                                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Excellent (9-10)**  | Code is clean, modular, and demonstrates excellent use of Python best practices. |
| **Good (7-8)**        | Code is mostly clean and modular, with minor issues in style or structure. |
| **Satisfactory (6)**  | Code works but has readability issues or does not fully follow best practices. |
| **Needs Improvement (0-5)** | Code is messy, poorly structured, or lacks adherence to best practices. |

## **Total Score**
The total score will be calculated by weighting each category as follows:
- **Core Functionality:** 40%
- **Enhancements:** 20%
- **Documentation:** 20%
- **Reflection:** 10%
- **Code Quality:** 10%

**Example:**
If a project scores 36/40 for Core Functionality, 18/20 for Enhancements, 17/20 for Documentation, 8/10 for Reflection, and 9/10 for Code Quality, the final grade will be:

```
Final Score = (36 × 0.4) + (18 × 0.2) + (17 × 0.2) + (8 × 0.1) + (9 × 0.1)
            = 14.4 + 3.6 + 3.4 + 0.8 + 0.9
            = 42.1/50 = 84.2%
```
