## 1. Algorithm Implementations

*Briefly describe your experience implementing each sorting algorithm. What challenges did you face? What was easier or harder than expected?*

### Bubble Sort
**Time Complexity:** O(n²)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)  
**Stable:** Yes

**Implementation Experience:**
[Write 2-3 sentences about implementing bubble sort. For example: "Bubble sort was straightforward to implement using nested loops. The main challenge was getting the loop bounds correct to avoid array index errors. I added an optimization to detect early termination when no swaps occur."]

**Key Implementation Details:**
- [Did you implement early termination optimization?]
- [Any specific challenges with the nested loop structure?]

### Merge Sort  
**Time Complexity:** O(n log n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)  
**Stable:** Yes

**Implementation Experience:**
[Write 2-3 sentences about implementing merge sort. For example: "Merge sort was more complex due to the recursion and merge operation. Understanding how to properly divide the array and merge sorted halves took some debugging. The recursive nature made it tricky to trace through initially."]

**Key Implementation Details:**
- [How did you handle the base case?]
- [Any difficulties with the merge operation?]

### Quicksort
**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case  
**Space Complexity:** O(log n) average  
**Stable:** No

**Implementation Experience:**
[Write 2-3 sentences about implementing quicksort. For example: "Quicksort's partitioning logic was the most challenging part. Getting the pivot placement and pointer management correct required careful debugging. The recursive structure was similar to merge sort but the partitioning was more complex."]

**Key Implementation Details:**
- [What pivot selection strategy did you use?]
- [Any issues with the partitioning logic?]

## 3. Algorithm Selection Recommendations

*Based on your performance analysis, when would you choose each algorithm?*

### When to Use Bubble Sort
**Recommended for:**
- [Example: Very small datasets (< 20 elements)]
- [Example: Educational purposes to understand basic sorting]
- [Example: When code simplicity is more important than performance]

**Avoid when:**
- [Example: Working with large datasets]
- [Example: Performance is critical]

### When to Use Merge Sort
**Recommended for:**
- [Example: Large datasets where consistent performance is needed]
- [Example: When stability is required (maintaining order of equal elements)]
- [Example: When worst-case O(n²) behavior must be avoided]

**Avoid when:**
- [Example: Memory usage is constrained]
- [Example: Working with very small arrays where overhead matters]

### When to Use Quicksort  
**Recommended for:**
- [Example: General-purpose sorting where average case matters most]
- [Example: When memory usage should be minimized]
- [Example: Random or well-distributed data]

**Avoid when:**
- [Example: Data might already be sorted (worst case)]
- [Example: Stability is required]
- [Example: Predictable performance is critical]
