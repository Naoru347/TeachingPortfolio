## Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Download Starter Files**
1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment link
2. Clone your repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd lab12-performance-report-[username]
   ```
3. Verify you have these starter files:
   - `SlowCode.java` (inefficient implementations to optimize)
   - `PerformanceAnalysis.java` (template for adding profiling)
   - `OptimizationReport.java` (template for implementing optimizations)
   - `TimingHelper.java` (timing utility methods - already implemented)
   - `test_data.txt` (test dataset)
   - `lab12_report_template.md` (report template)

### **Step 2: Initial Setup Test**
1. Compile and run the starter code:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   java SlowCode
   ```
2. You should see output showing slow algorithms running
3. Run the performance analysis template:
   ```bash
   java PerformanceAnalysis
   ```
4. This will show you where to add timing code

---

## Part 1: Understanding the Slow Code (15 minutes)

### **Analyze Provided Inefficient Implementations**
The `SlowCode.java` file contains several intentionally inefficient implementations:

1. **Inefficient Search** - Linear search in sorted data
2. **Poor Data Structure Choice** - Using ArrayList for frequent insertions
3. **Nested Loop Problem** - Unnecessary nested iterations
4. **String Concatenation Issue** - Building strings inefficiently

### **Your Task:**
1. **Read through SlowCode.java** and understand what each method does
2. **Run the timing tests** to see baseline performance:
   ```bash
   java SlowCode
   ```
3. **Identify obvious inefficiencies** by examining the code logic
4. **Note the timing results** - these are your "before" measurements

### **Initial Analysis Questions:**
- Which method takes the longest to execute?
- Can you spot why certain algorithms are slow?
- What data structures or algorithms could be improved?

---

## Part 2: Adding Profiling and Timing Code (25 minutes)

### **Implement Method-Level Profiling**
Complete the `PerformanceAnalysis.java` file to add detailed timing to the slow code:

```java
public class PerformanceAnalysis {
    
    public static void profileSlowMethods() {
        // TODO: Add timing code around each slow method
        // Use TimingHelper.startTiming() and TimingHelper.endTiming()
        // Measure each method individually to identify bottlenecks
        
        // Example pattern:
        // TimingHelper.startTiming("inefficientSearch");
        // SlowCode.inefficientSearch(...);
        // long searchTime = TimingHelper.endTiming("inefficientSearch");
        // System.out.println("Search took: " + searchTime + " ms");
    }
    
    public static void profileMemoryUsage() {
        // TODO: Add memory profiling before and after operations
        // Use Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() and freeMemory()
        // Calculate memory usage for data structure operations
    }
    
    public static void analyzeComplexityScaling() {
        // TODO: Run algorithms with different input sizes
        // Test with arrays of size 100, 500, 1000, 5000
        // Observe how execution time scales with input size
    }
}
```

### **Profiling Tasks:**
1. **Add timing measurements** around each slow method in SlowCode.java
2. **Measure memory usage** before and after data structure operations
3. **Test scaling behavior** with different input sizes (100, 500, 1000, 5000 elements)
4. **Document bottlenecks** - which methods consume the most time/memory?

### **Use the TimingHelper Utility:**
```java
// High-precision timing
TimingHelper.startTiming("methodName");
// ... code to measure
long elapsedMs = TimingHelper.endTiming("methodName");

// Memory measurement
long memoryBefore = TimingHelper.getMemoryUsage();
// ... code that uses memory
long memoryAfter = TimingHelper.getMemoryUsage();
long memoryUsed = memoryAfter - memoryBefore;
```

---

## Part 3: Implementing Optimizations (25 minutes)

### **Complete OptimizationReport.java**
Implement optimized versions of the slow methods. Focus on these common optimization strategies:

```java
public class OptimizationReport {
    
    // Optimization 1: Replace linear search with binary search
    public static int optimizedSearch(int[] sortedArray, int target) {
        // TODO: Implement binary search instead of linear search
        // Should reduce complexity from O(n) to O(log n)
        
        return -1; // Replace with binary search implementation
    }
    
    // Optimization 2: Use appropriate data structure
    public static void optimizedDataStructure() {
        // TODO: Replace ArrayList with LinkedList for frequent insertions
        // Or use other appropriate data structure based on usage pattern
        
        // Compare performance of:
        // - ArrayList vs LinkedList for insertions
        // - ArrayList vs HashMap for lookups
        // - Array vs Collection for iterations
    }
    
    // Optimization 3: Eliminate unnecessary nested loops
    public static int[] optimizedProcessing(int[] array) {
        // TODO: Replace nested loop approach with single-pass algorithm
        // Look for opportunities to combine operations or use better algorithms
        
        return null; // Replace with optimized implementation
    }
    
    // Optimization 4: Efficient string handling
    public static String optimizedStringBuilding(String[] words) {
        // TODO: Use StringBuilder instead of string concatenation
        // Reduce from O(nÂ²) to O(n) complexity
        
        return ""; // Replace with StringBuilder implementation
    }
}
```

### **Optimization Strategy Guide:**

**Algorithm Improvements:**
- Replace O(n) linear search with O(log n) binary search
- Use single-pass algorithms instead of nested loops
- Apply divide-and-conquer when appropriate

**Data Structure Optimizations:**
- Choose ArrayList for indexed access, LinkedList for frequent insertions
- Use HashMap for O(1) lookups instead of O(n) linear searches  
- Consider TreeMap when you need sorted keys with good lookup performance

**Memory and Object Creation:**
- Use StringBuilder for string concatenation
- Reuse objects when possible instead of creating new ones
- Choose primitive arrays over wrapper collections when appropriate

### **Implementation Requirements:**
1. **Implement at least 3 optimizations** from the categories above
2. **Keep original slow methods** for comparison
3. **Add timing measurements** to your optimized methods
4. **Document your optimization reasoning** in comments

---

## Part 4: Performance Comparison and Analysis (10 minutes)

### **Compare Before and After Performance**
Create comparison tests to measure improvement:

```java
public static void comparePerformance() {
    // TODO: Run identical tests on slow vs optimized methods
    // Calculate improvement percentages
    // Document which optimizations provided the most benefit
    
    System.out.println("=== PERFORMANCE COMPARISON ===");
    
    // Example pattern:
    long slowTime = measureSlowMethod();
    long fastTime = measureOptimizedMethod();
    double improvement = ((double)(slowTime - fastTime) / slowTime) * 100;
    
    System.out.printf("Search optimization: %.1f%% improvement\n", improvement);
}
```

### **Analysis Tasks:**
1. **Run timing comparisons** between original and optimized versions
2. **Calculate improvement percentages** for each optimization
3. **Identify the most impactful** optimizations
4. **Document performance gains** with specific numbers

### **Quick Analysis Questions:**
- Which optimization provided the largest performance gain?
- How did execution time scale with input size before vs. after optimization?
- Were there any optimizations that didn't help as much as expected?
