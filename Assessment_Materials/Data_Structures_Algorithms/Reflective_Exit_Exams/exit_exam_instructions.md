## Sample Evaluation Scenarios

### **High-Performing Student Example**
*"When asked about AVL tree rotations, the student not only explained the technical process but discussed why maintaining balance is crucial for search performance in their specific application. They reflected on initially implementing a basic BST and discovering performance degradation with ordered input, leading to their team's decision to upgrade to AVL. They could articulate the O(log n) guarantee and explain how this impacted their application's user experience."*

**Assessment:** **Excellent** technical mastery, **excellent** reflection and communication

### **Solid Student Example**  
*"The student could explain their hash table implementation correctly and discuss collision resolution strategies. When asked about performance optimization, they described their benchmarking process but had difficulty connecting results to theoretical predictions. They showed good self-awareness about areas where they relied heavily on teammates and could identify specific things they'd do differently."*

**Assessment:** **Good** technical mastery, **good** reflection and communication

### **Struggling Student Example**
*"The student could describe what their team built but struggled to explain technical decisions or their personal contributions. When asked about algorithm complexity, they gave memorized definitions but couldn't apply them to their specific implementations. They showed limited reflection on the learning process and difficulty articulating what they gained from the experience."*

**Assessment:** **Needs Improvement** technical mastery, **satisfactory** reflection and communication
