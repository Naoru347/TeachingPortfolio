# Milestone 2 Rubric

This rubric allocates 100% of your MilestoneÂ 2 grade. Use it to guide your work and verify you meet all criteria before submission.

| Category                              | Weight (%) | Description                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------|-----------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Implementation Correctness**        | **40**       | All required data structures (`BST`, `AVLTree`, `BinaryHeap`, `PriorityQueue`, `HashTable` strategies) implemented correctly with passing edge-case behavior. |
| **Performance Benchmarks & Analysis** | **30**       | Benchmark suite automates timing across varying data sizes; analysis compares empirical results to theoretical expectations with clear graphs/tables.         |
| **Code Organization & Readability**   | **15**       | Code is modular, well-named, follows style conventions, and includes inline comments where necessary; project structure supports easy navigation.        |
| **Documentation & Diagrams**          | **15**       | UML class hierarchy diagram accurately depicts ADT relationships; method documentation clearly explains API, complexity notes, and usage examples.      |
| **Total**                             | **100**      |                                                                                                                                                          |
