# Data Structures & Algorithms Semester Project

Welcome to your semester-long project!  In this project, you’ll work in teams to build a reusable data-structures & algorithms library and integrate it into a real-world application. Follow these general instructions throughout the semester.

## Getting Started
1. **Form your team** of 3–4 members and agree on communication channels.  Rotate roles each milestone (design, coding, testing, documentation).
2. **Clone this repo** to your local machine.
3. **Review milestone folders** (`milestone1/`, `milestone2/`, `milestone3/`). Each contains an `instructions.md` with detailed requirements and due dates.
4. **Branch & Tag**:
   - Create a branch named `milestoneX` before starting work on milestone X.
   - Tag your submissions with `milestone1`, `milestone2`, `milestone3` on or before deadlines.
5. **Submit** by pushing to your team repo and creating a pull request (PR) for each milestone.

## Milestone Overview
| Milestone | Due Week | Weight | Deliverable Folder         |
|----------:|:---------|-------:|---------------------------|
| 1 – Core DS Library       | Week 6  | 10%    | `milestone1/`             |
| 2 – Advanced ADT Extensions | Week 11 | 10%    | `milestone2/`             |
| 3 – Final Integration & App  | Week 16 | 10%    | `milestone3/`             |

Each `instructions.md` includes:
- Required classes and modules to implement
- Documentation templates (design docs, UML)
- Testing and benchmarking guidelines
- Submission checklist and rubric link

## General Workflow
- **Implement** code under `src/` according to the current milestone’s spec.
- **Document** design decisions using the provided templates in `docs/`.
- **Test & Benchmark** using your own test suites; record results in the milestone directory.
- **Peer Evaluate** after each milestone via the form in `docs/peer_evaluation_form.pdf`.
- **Review Rubric** located in each milestone folder to understand grading criteria.

## Communication & Support
- **Office Hours & TA Sessions:** See `/docs/office_hours_and_support.md`.
- **Issues & Questions:** Create GitHub Issues in this repo, prefixed with `milestoneX: `.
- **Discussions:** Use the team’s Discord/Slack channel for quick collaboration.

## Submission and Late Policy
- Milestones are due by 11:59 PM on their due week Friday.
- A 48‑hour grace period applies with a 10% penalty. After that, each day late incurs an additional 5% deduction.
- No late submissions accepted beyond one week after the due date without instructor approval.

**Good luck—build thoughtfully, test thoroughly, and document clearly!**
