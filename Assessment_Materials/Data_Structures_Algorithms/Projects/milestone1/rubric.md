# Milestone 1 Rubric

This rubric allocates 100% of your Milestone 1 grade. Your **score** for Milestone 1 will be a weighted sum of the categories below, plus an adjustment based on your peer evaluations.

| Category                              | Weight (%) | Description                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------|-----------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Implementation Correctness & Completeness** | **50**       | All required methods implemented to specification; correct behavior on normal and edge cases; exceptions thrown appropriately.                     |
| **Test Coverage & Quality**           | **20**       | Unit tests cover all classes and methods with ≥ 80% overall coverage; tests include both typical scenarios and edge-case/error conditions.         |
| **Design Document Quality**           | **15**       | Interface definitions, representation choices, and complexity analysis are clear, accurate, and well-formatted; diagrams and tables used effectively. |
| **Code Style & README**               | **10**       | Code follows naming conventions and style guidelines; `milestone1/README.md` gives clear compilation, execution, and usage instructions.           |
| **Peer Evaluation**                   | **5**        | Based on the average of peer evaluation scores (each teammate rates contributions 1–5); normalized so that an average score of 5 yields full 5%.     |
| **Total**                             | **100**      |                                                                                                                                                   |

## Peer Evaluation Calculation
1. Each teammate submits a confidential evaluation rating (1–5) for each member.
2. Your **Peer Evaluation Score** = (Average rating across peers ÷ 5) × 5.
   - Example: Average rating = 4 → (4/5) × 5 = 4% added toward your Milestone 1 grade.

Use this rubric to guide your work and verify you meet all criteria before submission. Good luck!
