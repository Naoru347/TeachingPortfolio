## Success Strategies

### Implementation Excellence
1. **Start with Interfaces**: Design clean, consistent interfaces first
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before or alongside implementation
3. **Incremental Development**: Implement one data structure at a time
4. **Edge Case Focus**: Spend significant time on boundary conditions

### Testing Best Practices
1. **Coverage Goals**: Aim for >90% coverage, not just the minimum 80%
2. **Meaningful Tests**: Focus on behavior verification, not just coverage
3. **Automated Testing**: Set up continuous testing in your development workflow
4. **Test Organization**: Group related tests and use descriptive names

### Documentation Quality
1. **Write as You Code**: Document design decisions during development
2. **Visual Aids**: Use diagrams to illustrate data structure organization
3. **User Perspective**: Write documentation for someone learning your code
4. **Technical Precision**: Be accurate in complexity analysis and specifications

### Team Collaboration
1. **Clear Division**: Assign specific data structures to individuals
2. **Interface Agreement**: Agree on interfaces before parallel development
3. **Regular Integration**: Merge code frequently to avoid conflicts
4. **Code Review**: Review each other's implementations before submission
5. **Fair Contribution**: Ensure balanced workload distribution

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Implementation Issues
- **Pointer Errors**: Null pointer exceptions and dangling pointers in linked structures
- **Index Management**: Off-by-one errors and improper boundary checking
- **Memory Leaks**: Failure to properly clean up removed nodes
- **Generic Type Errors**: Improper use of generics leading to type safety issues

### Testing Problems
- **Shallow Coverage**: Tests that achieve high coverage but don't verify correctness
- **Missing Edge Cases**: Failure to test empty structures, single elements, capacity limits
- **Test Dependencies**: Tests that rely on other tests or external state
- **Weak Assertions**: Tests that don't actually verify the expected behavior

### Documentation Issues
- **Incomplete Specifications**: Missing preconditions, postconditions, or exception conditions
- **Inaccurate Complexity**: Incorrect Big-O analysis or missing space complexity
- **Poor Explanations**: Technical content that's hard to understand
- **Missing Rationale**: Lack of explanation for design decisions
