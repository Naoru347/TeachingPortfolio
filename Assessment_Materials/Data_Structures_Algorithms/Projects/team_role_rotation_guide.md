# Team Roles Rotation Guide
## CSC 220: Data Structures & Algorithms - Semester Project

---

## Overview

To ensure balanced learning experiences and fair distribution of responsibilities, each team member will rotate through different leadership roles across the three project milestones. This approach helps you develop diverse skills while preventing any individual from being consistently overburdened.

**Core Principle:** Every team member should experience both technical and non-technical leadership responsibilities throughout the semester.

## Role Rotation Schedule

### Milestone 1 (Weeks 1-6): Core DS Library
**Recommended Initial Assignments:**
- **Design Lead:** Team member with strongest algorithmic background
- **Coding Lead:** Team member most comfortable with Git and IDE setup
- **Test Lead:** Team member interested in quality assurance
- **Documentation Lead:** Team member with strong writing skills

### Milestone 2 (Weeks 7-11): Advanced ADT Extensions  
**Required Rotation:** Each member takes a **different** role than Milestone 1
- Focus on expanding comfort zones
- Pair experienced members with those learning new skills

### Milestone 3 (Weeks 12-16): Final Integration & Application
**Required Rotation:** Each member takes their **third** role
- By this milestone, everyone should have experience in multiple areas
- Consider individual interests and project needs for final assignments

**Role Assignment Matrix Example (4-person team):**

| Team Member | Milestone 1 | Milestone 2 | Milestone 3 |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Alice | Design Lead | Coding Lead | Test Lead |
| Bob | Coding Lead | Test Lead | Documentation Lead |
| Carol | Test Lead | Documentation Lead | Design Lead |
| David | Documentation Lead | Design Lead | Coding Lead |

## Role Assignment Process

### Step 1: Initial Team Meeting (Week 1)
1. **Team Introduction:** Share backgrounds, strengths, and interests
2. **Role Preferences:** Discuss which roles each member prefers to try first
3. **Milestone 1 Assignment:** Assign roles based on initial preferences and project needs
4. **Rotation Planning:** Tentatively plan rotations for Milestones 2 and 3

### Step 2: Milestone Transition Meetings
**Timing:** First week of each new milestone

1. **Previous Milestone Reflection:** 
   - What went well in your current role?
   - What challenges did you face?
   - What would you do differently?

2. **Next Milestone Planning:**
   - Assign new roles (must be different from previous milestone)
   - Brief the incoming role holder on current status
   - Set expectations and responsibilities

3. **Knowledge Transfer:**
   - Outgoing role holder provides handoff documentation
   - New role holder reviews relevant materials and asks questions

---

## Team Size Adaptations

### 3-Person Teams
**Approach:** Combine roles strategically
- **Option 1:** One person takes both Design + Documentation Lead
- **Option 2:** One person takes both Test + Coding Lead  
- **Rotation:** Ensure everyone experiences both technical and communication-focused responsibilities

### 4+ Person Teams  
**Approach:** Split roles or add specialized positions
- Split Coding Lead into "Implementation Lead" and "Integration Lead"
- Add "Quality Assurance Lead" separate from Test Lead
- Create "Research Lead" for literature review and algorithm analysis

## Success Strategies

### For Role Leaders
1. **Delegate Effectively:** You're leading, not doing everything yourself
2. **Communicate Regularly:** Hold brief check-ins with team members
3. **Document Decisions:** Keep records of important choices and rationales
4. **Ask for Help:** Don't hesitate to seek guidance from teammates or instructors
5. **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate bottlenecks and resource needs

### for Team Members  
1. **Support the Leader:** Be responsive and proactive in your assigned tasks
2. **Provide Feedback:** Help leaders improve by offering constructive input
3. **Prepare for Your Turn:** Observe and learn from current role leaders
4. **Stay Engaged:** Participate actively even when not in a leadership role
5. **Cross-Train:** Learn about other roles to improve team effectiveness

### For the Entire Team
1. **Hold Regular Meetings:** Weekly check-ins are essential
2. **Use Project Management Tools:** GitHub Issues, Trello, or similar
3. **Establish Communication Protocols:** Response times, update frequencies
4. **Create Backup Plans:** What happens if someone is unavailable?
5. **Celebrate Successes:** Acknowledge good work and milestone achievements
