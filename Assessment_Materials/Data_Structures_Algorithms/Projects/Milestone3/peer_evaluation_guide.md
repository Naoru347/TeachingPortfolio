# Peer Evaluation Guide

Peer evaluations are a critical component of your team’s collaborative process. This guide explains how to complete evaluations, the criteria used, and how scores impact your milestone grades.

---

## 1. Purpose of Peer Evaluations
- **Accountability:** Ensure fair contribution and recognize individual efforts.  
- **Professional Feedback:** Develop the ability to give and receive constructive criticism.  
- **Grade Adjustment:** Average peer scores contribute to 5% of each milestone grade.

## 2. Evaluation Process
1. **Timeline:** Complete peer evaluations within 48 hours after each milestone deadline.  
2. **Form Access:** Use the PDF or online form linked in `/docs/peer_evaluation_form.pdf` or GitHub Issues template.  
3. **Confidentiality:** Submissions are confidential—only the instructor sees individual ratings.  
4. **Aggregation:** Your average teammate ratings (1–5) translate to up to 5% added or deducted per milestone.

## 3. Evaluation Criteria
Rate each teammate (including yourself) on a **1–5 scale** for each dimension:

| Criterion             | Description                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Quality of Work**   | Accuracy, completeness, and thoughtfulness of contributions (code, docs, tests).            |
| **Communication**     | Clarity, responsiveness, and collaboration in team discussions and meetings.                 |
| **Reliability**       | Meeting deadlines, attending team sessions, and following through on assigned tasks.        |
| **Initiative**        | Proactivity in identifying problems, proposing solutions, and offering extra help if needed. |
| **Professionalism**   | Respect, openness to feedback, and positive team attitude.                                  |

## 4. Rating Scale
- **5 (Excellent):** Consistently exceeded expectations; outstanding contributions.  
- **4 (Good):** Met expectations with quality work and active engagement.  
- **3 (Satisfactory):** Generally met expectations; minor gaps in contribution or communication.  
- **2 (Needs Improvement):** Inconsistent contributions or communication; significant gaps.  
- **1 (Unsatisfactory):** Failed to meet responsibilities; minimal or poor-quality contributions.

## 5. Providing Constructive Feedback
- **Be Specific:** Cite examples (e.g., “Alex implemented the rotation logic efficiently and documented edge cases.”).  
- **Be Balanced:** Highlight strengths and areas for growth.  
- **Be Respectful:** Maintain a professional tone; focus on behaviors, not personal traits.

---

## 6. Submission Instructions
1. **Complete Form:** Fill in ratings and optional comments for each teammate.
2. **Submit:** Upload your completed evaluation form to the course LMS under the appropriate milestone assignment.
3. **Deadline:** Submit by the milestone due date. Late submissions may not be accepted.

## 7. Impact on Grades. Impact on Grades
- **Calculation:** (Average rating ÷ 5) × 5% = peer evaluation score added to milestone grade.  
- **Example:** Average = 4 → (4/5) × 5% = 4% added to your milestone score.
