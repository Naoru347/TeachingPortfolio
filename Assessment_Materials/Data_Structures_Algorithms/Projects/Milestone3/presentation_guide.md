## 3. Timing & Speaker Allocation
- **Total Time:** 10 minutes (approx. 1 min per slide)  
- **Demo Time:** ~3 minutes (integrated into slide 5).  
- **Q&A:** Reserve ~5 minutes after slides.
- **Speaker Rotation:** Assign 2–3 slides to each member so everyone speaks at least once.  
   - E.g., Member A: Slides 1–3, Member B: Slides 4–6, Member C: Slides 7–9, Group Q&A.

## 4. Design & Delivery Tips
- **Clarity:** Use large fonts (≥ 24pt) and high-contrast colors.  
- **Brevity:** Limit text to bullet points; avoid dense paragraphs.  
- **Visuals:** Include screenshots, diagrams, and charts over text when possible.  
- **Consistency:** Use a cohesive template (colors, fonts, logo).  
- **Practice:** Rehearse transitions and timing; ensure demo runs smoothly.

---

## 5. Demo Script
- Provide `demo_script.md` with step-by-step commands or actions.  
- Include expected input and output examples.  
- Note any setup steps (e.g., sample data, command-line args).

---

## 6. File Naming & Submission
- **Slides:** `slides.pdf` or `slides.pptx` in `presentation/`.  
- **Demo Script:** `demo_script.md`.  
- **Ensure:** Files are linked in `milestone3/docs/README.md`.
