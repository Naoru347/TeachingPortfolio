# Final Report Guide

*Milestone 3 – Final Integration & Application*  
*Due: Final Exam Week (Week 16)*

Use this guide to structure and write your final report. Aim for **5–7 pages** (excluding title page and references).

---

## 1. Title Page
- Course name & number (CSC 220)  
- Project title (e.g., “Task Scheduler Application”)  
- Team member names & roles  
- Submission date

---

## 2. Executive Summary (½ page)
- Brief overview of application purpose and scope  
- Key features and accomplishments  
- Summary of performance results and optimizations

---

## 3. Architecture Overview (1–1.5 pages)
- **System Diagram:** High-level UML or block diagram showing modules and their interactions.
- **Component Descriptions:** Describe each major module/package (e.g., DS library, application logic, I/O).
- **Data Flow:** Explain how data moves through the system (e.g., user input → priority queue → scheduler output).

---

## 4. Performance Profiling & Optimization (1.5–2 pages)
- **Methodology:** Describe profiling tools used (e.g., Java Flight Recorder, custom timers).
- **Metrics Collected:** CPU time, memory usage, GC pauses (if relevant).
- **Baseline Results:** Present tables/charts of unoptimized performance.
- **Optimizations Applied:** List changes (e.g., improved data structure choice, algorithm tweaks).
- **Post-Optimization Results:** Show updated metrics and compare to baseline.

---

## 5. Design Trade-offs & Lessons Learned (1–1.5 pages)
- **Trade-offs:** Discuss alternatives considered (e.g., different ADTs, caching approaches).
- **Challenges & Resolutions:** Highlight any implementation obstacles and how you overcame them.
- **Team Process:** Reflect on collaboration, role rotation, and peer feedback use.

---

## 6. Future Work & Extensions (½–1 page)
- **Potential Enhancements:** Suggest new features (e.g., GUI interface, persistent storage).
- **Scalability Considerations:** How would your design adapt for larger data or distributed environments?
- **Research Directions:** Propose areas for further investigation (e.g., alternative algorithms, benchmarking frameworks).

---

## 7. References
- Cite external resources, libraries, and any online references you used.
- Use a consistent citation style (APA, IEEE, or similar).

---

## 8. Appendices (Optional)
- **Code Snippets:** Key algorithm excerpts (if not included in repo).  
- **Raw Data:** Extended benchmark tables.  
- **Additional Diagrams:** Sequence diagrams or detailed class diagrams.

**Formatting Tips:**
- Use headings and subheadings consistently.  
- Include tables and figures with captions (e.g., “Table 1: BST Insert Times”).  
- Keep paragraphs concise (3–5 sentences each).  
- Use consistent fonts and sizes; embed figures at appropriate resolution.  
- Proofread for grammar, clarity, and technical accuracy.
