# Holistic Scoring Guide for Oral Assessment (5% of Final Grade)

**Overview:**  
This oral assessment will be evaluated holistically. Rather than breaking down performance into separate categories, we will consider your overall demonstration of understanding, critical thinking, clarity of communication, and engagement as one integrated performance. Your final score will reflect how well you convey a comprehensive grasp of cybersecurity principles, your ability to reason through problems or questions, and how effectively you communicate and engage in the discussion.

Note that if any issues have arisen during the semester (e.g., academic integrity violations, attendance/participation issues, late work, etc.), students may be asked up to two questions about those issues and their impacts on their learning. Students can still receive full marks on these questions; however, the assessment will focus on the reflective quality of their responses and their future plans to prevent or mitigate such issues, allowing them to become successful learners.

**Total Weight:** 5% of the final course grade.

## Holistic Performance Levels

**5 Points (Exceptional Performance)**  
The student demonstrates an outstanding command of core cybersecurity concepts including the CIA triad, network security strategies, cryptographic methods, threat modeling, and security policy development. Explanations show depth, precision, and critical insight, clearly applying cybersecurity knowledge to new or complex scenarios. Communication is confident, clear, coherent, and accessible. The student engages fully and thoughtfully in the discussion, adeptly responding to follow-up questions. This performance indicates strong readiness for further cybersecurity study or professional practice.

**4 Points (Strong Performance)**  
The student exhibits a robust understanding of key cybersecurity concepts and practices, providing accurate and reasonably detailed explanations. Critical thinking is evident, and the student handles familiar and slightly altered scenarios effectively. Communication is generally clear and logical, with minor moments of hesitation. The student engages respectfully and professionally, showing solid preparedness for further study or entry-level roles in the field.

**3 Points (Competent Performance)**  
The student demonstrates a basic grasp of cybersecurity fundamentals such as network protocols, cryptographic techniques, and threat identification. Explanations are clear but may lack nuance or detail. Critical thinking and problem-solving are evident primarily in familiar contexts. Communication is understandable but may occasionally lack clarity. Engagement is consistent but somewhat limited. This performance indicates a functional understanding that would benefit from continued practice and reinforcement.

**2 Points (Developing Performance)**  
The student's understanding of cybersecurity concepts is partial or inconsistent. Explanations may be superficial, overly general, or reliant on memorization. Problem-solving and critical thinking attempts frequently overlook important details or key considerations. Communication may be unclear or disjointed at times, and the student may require prompting to engage effectively in the discussion. This level indicates the need for additional review and practice.

**0–1 Points (Insufficient Performance)**  
The student demonstrates minimal understanding of cybersecurity principles. Attempts to explain or answer questions are inaccurate, incomplete, or absent. Communication is frequently unclear, and engagement in the discussion is minimal. This performance suggests significant gaps in understanding and highlights a critical need for focused remediation and academic support.

**Note:**  
This holistic approach integrates conceptual mastery, reasoning skills, clarity of expression, and professional engagement into one overall judgment. The final score reflects a comprehensive impression of the student’s readiness, depth of learning, and ability to articulate and apply knowledge in a meaningful way.
