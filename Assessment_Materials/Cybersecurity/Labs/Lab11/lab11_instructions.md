# 🧪 Lab 11 – Project 2 Guided Work Session

**Lab Type:** In-class working session  
**Deliverable:** None (project-focused lab)  
**Due This Week:** Project 2: Network Security & Defense

---

## 📝 Overview

There is **no formal lab assignment this week**. Instead, you’ll use this session to work on your second major deliverable — **Project 2: Network Security & Defense**, due by the end of **Week 11**.

This lab is your dedicated time to test, troubleshoot, and document your defensive configurations inside your VirtualBox lab environment. You'll configure firewall rules, analyze network traffic, scan for vulnerabilities, and complete your APA-style narrative report — all while having instructor support available.

## ✅ What to Bring

- Your VirtualBox setup with all **three pre-configured VMs** (two Linux, one client)
- Notes from your firewall config, Wireshark capture, and Nmap scan
- Draft of your APA-formatted narrative report
- Screenshots you’ve taken so far (or need to take)
- Any questions you have about:
  - Network configuration and internal routing
  - Packet filtering or service visibility
  - Nmap flags and interpretation
  - APA formatting and citation

## 🧑‍🏫 Instructor Support During Lab

During this session, I’ll be available to assist with:

- Interpreting your Wireshark capture and identifying suspicious traffic
- Troubleshooting firewall behavior using `ufw` or `iptables`
- Reviewing your Nmap scan results and helping interpret open services
- Answering questions about documentation, formatting, or write-up tone
- Verifying that machines are properly communicating over the network

## 📚 Tips for Productive Use of Time

- Begin by verifying that all VMs can ping each other (if allowed)
- Capture and annotate:
  - Firewall rules for each machine
  - Output from `nmap` scans
  - Key Wireshark filters and traffic evidence
- Begin drafting the **Findings and Recommendations** section of your narrative
- Review the rubric to ensure your submission meets **all technical and writing expectations**
- Ask a peer to check your configs or review your justification write-up
