# Lab 2 – CIA Triad Case Study: Analyzing a Breach

## Overview
This week you’ll apply the **CIA Triad** — Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability — to a real-world security breach. You’ll examine what went wrong, which parts of the triad were violated, and what could have been done to prevent or reduce the impact.

This case-based lab is designed to strengthen your understanding of foundational security principles while helping you think critically about how theory meets practice.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Apply the CIA Triad framework to real cybersecurity incidents
- Identify which aspects of security were most affected in a given breach
- Propose high-level countermeasures aligned with CIA principles
- Communicate security analysis in clear, structured writing

---

## Instructions
### Step 1: Choose a Breach (5 minutes)
Select **one** of the following breaches to analyze:
- **Equifax (2017)** – Sensitive data breach affecting 147M people
- **Target (2013)** – Credit card data breach via third-party HVAC vendor
- **Colonial Pipeline (2021)** – Ransomware attack causing fuel shortages

You may also propose a different breach if it has publicly available details — get approval first.

### Step 2: Research the Incident (15 minutes)
Begin by reading about your chosen breach in the attached case files
- equifax_2017.pdf
- target_2013.pdf
- colonial_pipeline_2021.pdf

Supplement this case file with reliable information from:
- News articles from reputable sources (e.g., Wired, CNN, NYT)
- Cybersecurity blogs (e.g., Krebs on Security, CISA.gov advisories)
- Official statements or postmortem reports

Note details such as:
- What happened and how the attack unfolded
- What kinds of data/systems were affected
- Who was impacted (users, company, third parties)

### Step 3: Apply the CIA Triad (30 minutes)
For each part of the triad:
- **Confidentiality** – Was sensitive data exposed or accessed without authorization?
- **Integrity** – Was data tampered with, deleted, or modified?
- **Availability** – Did the attack prevent access to systems or data?

In each case, briefly explain **how** the attack affected that security goal.

Then, based on your analysis, suggest 2–3 preventive steps the organization could have taken that align with CIA principles. Keep them high-level (e.g., "apply timely patches," "segment networks," etc.).

### Step 4: Finalize and Submit (15 minutes)
Write up your findings in a clear, professional format. Proofread and convert your file to PDF before submitting it to the LMS.

---

## Deliverable
Submit a **1–2 page PDF report** that includes:
1. A short summary of the breach (1 paragraph)
2. A CIA Triad analysis (1 paragraph per principle)
3. 2–3 brief recommended countermeasures
