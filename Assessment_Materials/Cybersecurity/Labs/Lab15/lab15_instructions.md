## üåê Tips for Success
- **Prioritize containment** early: how can you limit the damage?
- **Be realistic**: assume limited resources, panicked users, and incomplete information.
- **Communicate clearly**: what should leadership and employees know (and not know) at each stage?
- **Focus on recovery**: what systems or data are most critical to restore first?
