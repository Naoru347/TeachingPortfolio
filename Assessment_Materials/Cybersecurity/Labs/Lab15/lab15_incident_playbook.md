## ⏰ Immediate Actions Checklist (First Response)
If you suspect a breach or ransomware event:

- ✅ **Isolate Affected Systems**
  - Disconnect devices from wired and wireless networks immediately.
  - Disable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and unplug Ethernet cables.
  - Do not power down unless absolutely necessary (e.g., active ransomware spread).

- ✅ **Document Everything**
  - Record the exact time and method of discovery.
  - Note any unusual system behavior (pop-ups, file changes, ransom notes).
  - Take screenshots, photos, or video if feasible without risking further damage.

- ✅ **Notify the Incident Response Team**

- **GDPR (EU):**
  - Report qualifying breaches within 72 hours to supervisory authorities.
