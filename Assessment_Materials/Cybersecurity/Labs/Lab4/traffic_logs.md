# Simulated Wi-Fi Traffic Logs â€“ Lab 4 Case Data (CSV Format)

Below is a simulated log of wireless access points and connected clients. This dataset is intended for educational use in identifying potentially rogue or misconfigured devices.

## Notes for Analysis:
- All legitimate SecureNet access points are supposed to be WPA2 encrypted and operated on channel 6.
- The official MAC address range for company-owned APs begins with `00:11` or `00:AA`.
- GuestNet and IoT_Devices are legitimate SSIDs for internal use.
- Check for duplicate SSIDs with mismatched encryption types or MACs.

Use this data in conjunction with the `airodump-ng` output and device authorization list to:
- Identify rogue APs based on SSID spoofing, unauthorized MAC prefixes, or improper encryption
- Determine if any official SSIDs are being broadcast by unknown devices
- Flag suspicious entries for your team report
