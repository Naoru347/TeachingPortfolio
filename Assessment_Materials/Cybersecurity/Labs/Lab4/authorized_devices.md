## Internal Notes:
- **SecureNet** is the primary internal SSID for employees. All approved MACs are WPA2-encrypted and operate on **Channel 6**.
- **CorpWiFi** is an internal network used by administrative staff. All MACs should use **WPA2 with PSK** and operate on **Channel 11**.
- **GuestNet** is a WPA2-encrypted guest SSID for visitors. It also operates on **Channel 11**.
- **IoT_Devices** is used for smart sensors and internal IoT traffic. This SSID should appear only on **Channel 1**.

This list should be used in conjunction with the Wi-Fi traffic logs and airodump-ng output to detect unauthorized access points broadcasting known SSIDs or unexpected SSIDs altogether.
