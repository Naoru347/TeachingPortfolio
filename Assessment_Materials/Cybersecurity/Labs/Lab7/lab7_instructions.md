# Lab 7 – Hardening Checklist Exercise

## Overview

In this lab, you’ll gain hands-on experience applying basic system hardening techniques to a pre-configured **Ubuntu Linux virtual machine (VM)** provided by your instructor. System hardening is a key part of defensive cybersecurity and involves reducing potential attack surfaces by disabling unnecessary features, applying updates, and enforcing good security practices.

This lab helps you practice working through a real-world checklist used by entry-level system administrators and junior security analysts to secure machines before deployment.

## Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Apply basic security configuration changes to a Linux system
- Identify and disable unneeded user accounts and services
- Update installed software packages
- Verify system permissions and security settings

---

## Setup Instructions
1. Launch **VirtualBox** from your lab workstation.
2. Start the provided Linux VM for Lab 7 (instructor will share filename).
3. Log in using the credentials provided by your instructor.
  - Username: UbuntuSA
  - Password: Humanity2Others!
4. Open a terminal window.

## Instructions
You will work **individually** for this lab.

Use the checklist provided in the Lab 7 worksheet to:
1. Review current system settings
2. Apply recommended changes
3. Record what you changed and how you verified it

Complete all tasks marked as required. Optional tasks may be attempted for bonus points or additional practice.

Each item on the checklist corresponds to a specific security goal, such as:
- Ensuring all software is up to date
- Disabling unnecessary user accounts (e.g., guest)
- Checking for and disabling unnecessary services
- Enforcing password policies or access control restrictions

---

## Deliverable
- Submit your completed Lab 7 worksheet via the LMS.
- File must be named: `Lastname_Firstname_Lab7.pdf`
- Due by **11:59 PM Sunday (Week 7)**

---

## Tips for Success
- Use `man` pages and `--help` to learn more about any unfamiliar command.
- If a command fails, read the error message carefully—it often tells you what went wrong.
- When in doubt, document your steps clearly and ask for guidance if you’re stuck.

**Security isn’t just about tools—it’s about habits. This lab helps you build habits for secure system setup and review.**
