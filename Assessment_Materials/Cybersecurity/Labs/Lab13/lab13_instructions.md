# 📊 Lab 13 – Vulnerability Report Analysis

**Lab Type:** Hands-on technical analysis  
**Deliverable:** Completed worksheet (PDF submission)  
**Due:** Sunday (Week 13) by 11:59 PM

---

## 📅 Overview

In this lab, you will step into the role of a junior security analyst tasked with interpreting and prioritizing vulnerabilities from a **sample vulnerability scan report**. You’ll analyze real-world style findings, rank the risks, and propose practical remediations.

This exercise builds your skills in:
- Understanding vulnerability report outputs (similar to Nessus or OpenVAS)
- Prioritizing risks using CVSS scores and business impact thinking
- Proposing clear, actionable remediation steps

These are key skills used daily in security operations centers (SOCs) and consulting firms.

---

## 🔧 Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Interpret basic vulnerability report entries
- Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and context
- Recommend appropriate remediation strategies
- Communicate technical risks clearly and effectively

---

## 📍 Instructions
You will work **individually** on this lab.

1. Review the **sample vulnerability report** provided (posted to LMS).
2. Complete the associated worksheet, which includes:

   ### Part A: Vulnerability Prioritization
   - Rank the listed vulnerabilities from **highest** to **lowest** priority.
   - Justify your ranking based on:
     - CVSS score
     - Business impact potential
     - Ease of exploitation

   ### Part B: Remediation Recommendations
   - For each vulnerability, propose a brief, realistic remediation step.
   - Explain why your proposed fix would reduce risk.

   ### Part C: Critical Thinking
   - Choose **one** vulnerability you believe is most urgent to fix.
   - In 1–2 paragraphs, justify your choice, referencing risk, business impact, and practicality.

---

## 📂 Deliverable
- Submit your completed worksheet as a **PDF** file.
- Filename format: `Lastname_Firstname_Lab13.pdf`
- Upload via LMS by **11:59 PM Sunday (Week 13)**

---

## 🔹 Resources
- Week 13 lecture slides (vulnerability management & CVSS)
- Sample CVSS calculator (optional for deeper exploration)
  - Official NIST CVSS Calculator: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator
- Sample vulnerability descriptions in the provided report

---

## 📈 Tips for Success
- Don't just rely on the CVSS score! Think about the context (e.g., a "Medium" score affecting a public-facing web server may be a higher real-world risk).
- Be practical: recommend remediations that a small IT team could realistically perform.
- Write clearly—imagine you're handing your report to a manager who has to prioritize work.

**Professional security work is as much about good communication as it is about robusttechnical skill. This lab helps build both. Good luck!**
