# Lab 1 – Security Analyst Role Exploration

## Overview
Welcome to your first cybersecurity lab! This activity is designed to help you begin thinking like a professional in the field. In this lab, you’ll investigate what real-world employers expect from entry-level cybersecurity analysts by examining current job postings.

The goal is to connect what you’ll learn in this course to actual career paths and industry expectations. You’ll walk away with a clearer idea of what tools, skills, and certifications matter — and begin developing a vocabulary you can use in interviews and résumés.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Identify common responsibilities of entry-level cybersecurity professionals
- Recognize frequently mentioned tools, platforms, and skills in job postings
- Reflect on which skills you’re most interested in developing
- Begin mapping course topics to professional applications

## Instructions
### Step 1: Locate 2–3 Job Postings
Use job platforms such as:
- LinkedIn Jobs
- Indeed
- CyberSeek.org
- Local or regional job boards

Search for entry-level roles with titles like:
- **Cybersecurity Analyst**
- **Information Security Analyst**
- **SOC Analyst (Tier 1)**
  - SOC = Security Operations Center
- **IT Security Intern / Associate**

Try to focus on roles that:
- Require 0–2 years of experience
- Do **not** require a security clearance (unless that interests you)
- Are located within a reasonable geographic range or are remote

### Step 2: Analyze the Job Ads
Create a table or bulleted list for each posting with the following information:
- **Job Title**
- **Company Name & Location**
- **Top 3 Responsibilities** listed
- **Top 3 Skills/Tools** required (e.g., Wireshark, Splunk, Python, etc.)
- **Certifications Mentioned** (e.g., CompTIA Security+, CISSP/SecurityX, Certified Ethical Hacker etc.)
- **Soft Skills** or other traits emphasized (e.g., communication, teamwork)

### Step 3: Reflect
Write a short (1–2 paragraph) reflection addressing:
- Which of the skills/tools are you most excited to learn in this course?
- Which responsibilities surprised or interested you the most?
- How do you think this class can help prepare you for these roles?

## Deliverable
Submit a **single PDF file** that includes:
1. The job posting breakdowns (2–3 total)
2. Your written reflection

**File Naming Convention:** `Lastname_Firstname_Lab1.pdf`

## Suggested Time: 45–60 minutes
You’ll have class time to complete most of this lab. If you don’t finish in class, you can submit it by the next session.
