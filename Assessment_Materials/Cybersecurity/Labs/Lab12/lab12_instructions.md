# üìä Lab 12 ‚Äì Risk Analysis: VPN vs. Zero Trust

**Lab Type:** Comparative analysis and discussion  
**Deliverable:** Completed worksheet (PDF submission)  
**Due:** Sunday (Week 12) by 11:59 PM

## üìÖ Overview

In this lab, you'll explore two different security approaches for supporting remote workers: **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** and **Zero Trust Architectures (ZTA)**. These models represent different ways of thinking about access control and network security in a world where employees often work from home or public networks.

You'll analyze each model in terms of how it protects data, manages risk, and supports usability. You'll then evaluate a fictional company scenario and decide which model is more appropriate for their remote access needs.

This lab builds skills in cybersecurity policy analysis, risk modeling, and communication with stakeholders.

## üîß Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Explain how VPNs and Zero Trust architectures function
- Identify strengths and limitations of each approach
- Analyze trade-offs in security, cost, and implementation complexity
- Justify a security recommendation based on organizational needs

## üìç Instructions
You will work **individually or in pairs** to complete the worksheet provided on the LMS. This worksheet includes:

### Part A: Background Summary
- In your own words, summarize how VPNs and Zero Trust work.
- Identify three pros and three cons for each approach.

### Part B: Scenario Analysis
You'll be given a scenario describing a fictional company, including:
- Workforce distribution (in-office vs. remote)
- Budget constraints
- IT staffing and resources
- Data sensitivity and compliance needs

Based on this context:
- Identify key risks related to remote access
- Recommend either a VPN-based or Zero Trust model
- Justify your choice using principles of cybersecurity, cost-efficiency, and usability

### Part C: Reflection
- Which model would you prefer as an employee? Why?
- What challenges might an organization face when transitioning to a Zero Trust model?
