## Scoring Guidelines
- **A (90–100%)**  
  Excellent work that exceeds expectations. Analysis is thorough, recommendations are well-reasoned, and the summary is clear, professional, and appropriately formatted.

- **B (80–89%)**  
  Strong work with minor gaps. The student shows solid understanding and communication but may need refinement in depth, tone, or formatting.

- **C (70–79%)**  
  Adequate but underdeveloped. Work is functional but lacks detail, contains several issues with organization or clarity, and may miss important vulnerabilities or justifications.

- **D/F (<70%)**  
  Work shows limited understanding or serious problems. Analysis is incomplete, recommendations are inappropriate, or formatting and communication do not meet expectations.
