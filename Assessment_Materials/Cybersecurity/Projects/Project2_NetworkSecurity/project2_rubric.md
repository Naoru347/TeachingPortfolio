# Project 2: Network Security & Defense Lab – Analytic Grading Rubric

Use this rubric to evaluate each student’s lab documentation and network configuration work. The total possible score is **100%**. Each criterion is weighted as shown.

## Scoring Guidelines
- **A (90–100%)**  
  Excellent work demonstrating strong understanding, clear communication, and thoughtful application of network defense skills.

- **B (80–89%)**  
  Strong and competent work with some room for refinement. Student meets core requirements with minor issues.

- **C (70–79%)**  
  Functional but underdeveloped. Student shows effort but lacks depth or accuracy in multiple areas.

- **D/F (<70%)**  
  Limited or insufficient. Major components missing or poorly executed, indicating weak engagement with assignment goals.
