# Collaboration Documentation Guide – Java Midterm Project

For the Java midterm project, collaboration is an integral part of your grade. Each team member must submit a **Collaboration Documentation Report** that outlines their contributions and provides a fair evaluation of their teammates. This report demonstrates your role in the project and promotes accountability and transparency in team-based work.

---

## **Part 1: Personal Contributions**

Describe your individual responsibilities and involvement in the project. Provide clear, specific evidence of your effort and tasks completed.

### **What to Include:**

1. **Role(s) Taken On:**
   - Clearly state your assigned or assumed role(s) in the project (e.g., Team Lead, Java Developer, Debugger, Documentation Lead).
   - If you wore multiple hats, describe how you managed them.

2. **Specific Contributions:**
   - Java classes or methods you wrote (e.g., implemented menu navigation, developed core business logic, built a utility method).
   - Testing, debugging, or refactoring tasks you handled.
   - Contributions to GitHub repository structure, class diagrams, or documentation files like `README.md`.

3. **Time and Effort:**
   - Approximate how many hours you worked.
   - Mention any additional work such as extra debugging sessions, writing helper functions, or helping teammates with Git.

**Example:**
- *“As the Lead Developer, I built the `Car.java` class and helped integrate inventory operations in `DealershipApp.java`. I spent about 18 hours coding and 4 hours reviewing PRs. I also helped set up our GitHub repo and ensured everyone’s branch was properly merged.”*

## **Part 2: Teammate Assessments**

Evaluate each of your teammates respectfully, honestly, and constructively.

### **What to Include:**

1. **Teammate Name and Role(s):**
   - Identify what responsibilities they took on (e.g., UI Designer, Testing Lead, Git Coordinator).

2. **Contribution Description:**
   - Describe what they actually completed or participated in.

3. **Strengths:**
   - Highlight strengths in collaboration, technical ability, or project organization.

4. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - Offer one or two actionable pieces of feedback to help them improve.

5. **Rating System (Out of 5 Stars):**

| Category        | Description                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Communication   | Did they communicate regularly and clearly?  |
| Reliability     | Did they meet deadlines and expectations?    |
| Quality of Work | Was their code effective and bug-free?       |

### **Example Ratings Table:**

| **Teammate**   | **Role(s)**       | **Communication** | **Reliability** | **Quality of Work** | **Overall Rating** |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Jamie Lin      | Testing Lead      | ★★★★☆            | ★★★★☆          | ★★★★★              | ★★★★☆             |
| Raj Patel      | Git Coordinator   | ★★★☆☆            | ★★☆☆☆          | ★★★☆☆              | ★★★☆☆             |

## **Formatting and Submission**

- **Length:** 2–3 pages, single-spaced.
- **Structure:**  
  - Header: Your name, project title, and team name  
  - Part 1: Personal Contributions (1–2 pages)  
  - Part 2: Teammate Assessments (1 page)

- **Format:** Save and submit as a **PDF**.
- **Deadline:** Submit via the course LMS alongside your final project codebase.

---

## **Professionalism Guidelines**

- **Be Respectful:** Avoid personal criticism; focus on actions and impact.
- **Be Honest:** These evaluations help the instructor ensure fair credit.
- **Be Specific:** Vague feedback like “They were great” is less helpful than “They always responded to pull request comments and updated their code on time.”

**Example:**
- Instead of *“Zara didn’t do much,”* say *“Zara had trouble getting started with Java, but once paired with another teammate, contributed significantly to the inventory value calculation method.”*
