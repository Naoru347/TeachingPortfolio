# Collaboration Documentation Guide

For the midterm project, collaboration is an integral part of your grade. Each team member must submit a **Collaboration Documentation Report** that outlines their contributions and provides an evaluation of their teammates' contributions. This guide explains how to structure your report.

## **Part 1: Personal Contributions**

Describe your role and specific contributions to the project. Provide enough detail to demonstrate your involvement and effort.

### **What to Include:**

1. **Role(s) Taken On:**
   - Clearly state your role(s) in the project (e.g., project manager, developer, tester).
   - If you handled multiple roles, explain how you balanced them.

2. **Specific Contributions:**
   - Tasks you completed (e.g., writing code, debugging, documentation).
   - Features or functionality you were responsible for.
   - Challenges you faced and how you addressed them.

3. **Time and Effort:**
   - Estimate the number of hours you worked on the project.
   - Highlight any extra efforts you made to support the team.

**Example:**
- *"As the project manager, I set up the GitHub repository, assigned tasks to team members, and ensured deadlines were met. I also developed the main algorithm for processing data and reviewed code written by others. I spent approximately 15 hours coding and 5 hours managing the project."*

## **Guidelines for Professionalism**

- **Be Respectful:** Frame your feedback constructively and focus on actions, not personal attributes.
- **Be Honest:** Your assessments will remain confidential and will help ensure fair grading.
- **Be Specific:** Avoid vague statements like "They were good." Instead, explain why and provide examples.

**Example:**
- Instead of *"Bob didn’t contribute much,"* write *"Bob missed two meetings and didn’t complete their assigned task on time. However, they contributed useful debugging suggestions during our final review."*
