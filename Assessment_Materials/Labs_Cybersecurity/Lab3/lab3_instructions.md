# Lab 3 – Network Diagramming: Home or Small Office Network

## Overview
This lab introduces you to the fundamentals of network architecture by having you design and annotate a basic network diagram. Whether you’re diagramming your home Wi-Fi setup or a small office LAN, you’ll apply core networking concepts while becoming familiar with standard symbols and common devices.

Visualizing how data flows through devices is a foundational skill in cybersecurity — both for understanding vulnerabilities and planning defenses.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Identify and represent common network devices and topologies
- Use standard symbols to create a professional-looking diagram
- Explain basic functions of each network component
- Recognize areas of security concern in small networks

---

## Instructions
### Step 1: Choose a Network Context
Pick one of the following:
- Your actual **home network**
- A **small office** (e.g., dentist's office, nonprofit organization, small retail shop)

Base your diagram on real or realistic layouts and assumptions. Keep it small and manageable (no more than 12 devices).

### Step 2: Draft the Network Diagram
Create a **logical network diagram** that includes:
- Internet/cloud connection
- Modem and router
- Any switches, hubs, or firewalls (if applicable)
- End-user devices (laptops, desktops, printers, smart devices)
- Optional servers (file server, NAS, etc.)

Use **standard symbols** to represent each device or node. Label each component clearly.

You may draw your diagram by hand and scan it, or use diagramming software like:
- draw.io / diagrams.net (free and easy)
- Lucidchart (education accounts available)
- Microsoft Visio (if available)

### Step 3: Annotate Your Diagram
Next to or underneath your diagram, include brief notes explaining:
- The **function** of each key device (e.g., “Router assigns IP addresses and forwards traffic.”)
- How the devices connect to each other (wired, wireless)
- Any security-relevant information (e.g., “Firewall blocks incoming traffic by default.”)

### Step 4: Highlight Security Zones (Optional)
If you’d like to go further, use a colored marker or text box to show:
- Trusted vs. untrusted areas
- Wi-Fi segmentation (guest network vs. internal)
- IoT device isolation

## Deliverable
Submit a **single PDF** that includes:
1. Your completed and labeled network diagram
2. Annotations or a short description (either on the diagram or on a separate page)

**File Naming Convention:** `Lastname_Firstname_Lab3.pdf`

## Suggested Time: 60–65 minutes (in class)
You’ll have time to complete this during the scheduled lab session. Bring your laptop or tablet if you prefer to use software; otherwise, paper and pens will be available.

This lab strengthens your understanding of how devices connect and communicate, and how even small networks can benefit from thoughtful planning and segmentation. Future labs will build on this visual and structural foundation.
