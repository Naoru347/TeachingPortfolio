# Lab 9 ‚Äì Manual Encryption & Decryption

## Overview
In this lab, you‚Äôll step into the shoes of a pre-digital-era cryptographer by learning to encrypt and decrypt text using two classic substitution ciphers: the **Caesar Cipher** and the **Vigen√®re Cipher**. These methods are foundational in the history of cryptography and offer insight into how modern encryption algorithms evolved.

You will manually encrypt and decrypt short messages using paper or a digital worksheet. While these methods are no longer secure for real-world use, they remain important for understanding basic encryption principles such as key usage, substitution patterns, and message confidentiality.

## Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Explain how substitution ciphers work
- Encrypt plaintext using Caesar and Vigen√®re ciphers
- Decrypt ciphertext using a given key
- Compare the strengths and weaknesses of each method

---

## Instructions
You will work **in pairs**. For each cipher, you‚Äôll complete the following:

### üîê Part A: Caesar Cipher
1. Choose a shift key (e.g., 3).
2. Encrypt a plaintext message.
3. Swap your ciphertext messages with another group.
4. Decrypt the other group's ciphertext. You will not be told the key ‚Äî try to deduce it by analyzing the ciphertext.
5. Write down your encryption and decryption steps and results.
6. Verify your decryption with the other group that you swapped with. 
  - If you successfully decrypt the other group's ciphertext before the end of the lab period, bring your decrypted plaintext and the encrypted ciphertext from the other group to the instructor for validation.

### üîê Part B: Vigen√®re Cipher
1. Use the following keyword: **hopper**
2. Encrypt a new plaintext message using the Vigen√®re table (see handout).
3. Attempt to decrypt a provided ciphertext (see handout) using a keyword that you deduce.
  - As a bonus: 10 points will be rewarded to the groups that successfully retrieve the plaintext by the end of the period.
  - Keyword: **cipher** [HIDE FROM STUDENTS]
4. Write down your full encryption and decryption process.

### üîç Part C: Reflection
1. Which cipher was easier to work with? Why?
2. What are the weaknesses of these ciphers in modern contexts?
3. What does this activity teach you about the importance of key secrecy, even in simple or outdated encryption systems?

## Deliverable
- Submit your answers to all parts of the lab using the worksheet provided.
- You may write by hand and submit a scan/photo or complete it digitally.
- Upload to LMS as `Lastname_Firstname_Lab9.pdf`
- Due by **11:59 PM Sunday (Week 9)**

---

## Materials Needed
- Lab 9 worksheet (provided)
- Vigen√®re table (provided or available online)
- Optional: scratch paper, Caesar wheel template

---

## Tip
Take your time decoding‚Äîaccuracy is more important than speed. These ciphers are fun, but they require careful attention to detail!

*Time Management Note*: You should spend approximately 20‚Äì25 minutes on Part A, 25‚Äì30 minutes on Part B, and 10 minutes on the reflection.

**Modern cryptography may be complex, but it all started with simple ciphers like these. Understanding the past helps you secure the future.**
