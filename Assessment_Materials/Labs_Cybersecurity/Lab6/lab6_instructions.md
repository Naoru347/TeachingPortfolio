# Lab 6 ‚Äì Command Line Scavenger Hunt

## Overview

In this lab, you'll explore core system-level concepts by using common command line tools to examine operating system internals. You'll use basic **Linux commands** inside a pre-configured **Linux virtual machine (VM)** provided by your instructor. This VM will be run in **VirtualBox** on lab computers.

This scavenger hunt builds your comfort with the command line, improves your troubleshooting skills, and lays the foundation for tasks like log analysis, process monitoring, and system auditing.

---

## Objectives
By the end of this lab, you should be able to:
- Navigate a file system using command line tools
- List and describe running processes
- Inspect user accounts and group permissions
- View startup programs and scheduled tasks
- Identify system configurations and logs

---

## Setup Instructions
1. Launch **VirtualBox** from your lab desktop.
2. Select and start the provided Linux VM (your instructor will specify the filename and configuration).
3. Log in using the credentials provided on the board or in the LMS.
4. Open a terminal window to begin the scavenger hunt.

---

## Instructions
You may work **individually or in pairs** for this lab. Answer each question below by running the appropriate command in the Linux VM and briefly describing what it does.

Complete your answers in the worksheet provided on the LMS.
