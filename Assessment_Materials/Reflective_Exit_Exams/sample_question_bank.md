11. **Arrays and Lists (If Covered)**  
    - What is an array (or list), and how do you access individual elements?  
    - How would you iterate over all elements of an array to perform an action on each?

12. **Strings (If Covered)**  
    - How is a string different from other data types?  
    - Give an example of manipulating or checking a string’s content.

13. **Error Handling and Debugging**  
    - How do you approach debugging when your program doesn’t behave as expected?  
    - Give an example of a common error (like an off-by-one error) and how you’d fix it.

14. **Testing and Validation**  
    - Why is testing your code important, and when should you do it?  
    - What are some simple methods you can use to verify that your program works as intended?

15. **Comments and Code Clarity**  
    - Why are comments useful, and how much should you rely on them?  
    - How would you write code in a way that’s easy for others to understand?

16. **Modularity and Reusability**  
    - Why is it better to break your code into smaller, reusable functions or modules?  
    - Describe a scenario where modularizing your code saved time or effort.

17. **Algorithmic Thinking**  
    - How do you break down a complex task into smaller steps before coding?  
    - Describe the approach you’d take to solve a basic problem (e.g., finding the largest number in a list).

18. **Efficiency Considerations**  
    - Why might efficiency matter, even at an introductory level?  
    - Give an example of a simple improvement that could make your program run faster.

19. **Comparing Programming Languages**  
    - Have you noticed any differences in syntax or style between programming languages you’ve seen?  
    - Why might a developer choose one programming language over another?

20. **Practical Applications**  
    - Give an example of a real-world problem that can be solved by writing a simple program.  
    - How does learning basic programming skills help you in fields beyond computer science?
