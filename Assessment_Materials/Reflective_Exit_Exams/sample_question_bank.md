# Oral Assessment Questions - Intro to Programming

**Instructions:**  
- During the oral assessment, each student will be asked approximately 3–5 questions from the list below.  
- The assessment will last about 15 minutes per student.  
- Questions will be chosen to gauge students' understanding of core concepts, their ability to think critically, and their communication skills.  
- Assessment criteria will include:  
  - Depth of conceptual understanding  
  - Ability to apply knowledge to new or slightly altered problems  
  - Clarity and coherence of explanations  
  - Demonstration of critical thinking and problem-solving strategies

## Core Programming Concepts

### Variables and Data Types
- Explain what a variable is and how it’s used in a program.  
- How do you decide which data type (e.g., `int`, `float`, `string`) to use for a given piece of information?

### Operators and Expressions
- What’s the difference between the assignment operator (`=`) and the equality operator (`==`)?  
- Give an example of using arithmetic operators to calculate and store a value.

### Input and Output
- How would you read input from a user and then display the result back to them?  
- Why is it important to format output in a user-friendly way?

### Conditional Statements
- Describe how an `if` statement works and give an example of when you would use one.  
- What’s the difference between using multiple `if` statements versus using `if…else if…else` chains?

### Boolean Logic
- How do logical operators like `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT) work in decision-making?  
- Walk me through a scenario where you’d need to combine multiple conditions before making a decision.

### Loops and Iteration
- Explain the difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop.  
- Why might you choose a `for` loop over a `while` loop or vice versa?

### Loop Applications
- Describe a situation where you’d use a loop to process a list of items.  
- How would you stop a loop from running under certain conditions?

## Functions and Modularity

### Functions and Methods
- What is a function, and why do we use them in programming?  
- Explain the difference between defining a function and calling a function.

### Parameters and Return Values
- How do parameters help make functions more flexible?  
- What’s the difference between a function that returns a value and one that doesn’t?

### Scope of Variables
- What does variable scope mean and why does it matter?  
- What happens if you try to access a variable outside of its scope?

## Data Structures and String Manipulation

### Arrays and Lists (If Covered)
- What is an array (or list), and how do you access individual elements?  
- How would you iterate over all elements of an array to perform an action on each?

### Strings (If Covered)
- How is a string different from other data types?  
- Give an example of manipulating or checking a string’s content.

## Debugging, Testing, and Best Practices

### Error Handling and Debugging
- How do you approach debugging when your program doesn’t behave as expected?  
- Give an example of a common error (like an off-by-one error) and how you’d fix it.

### Testing and Validation
- Why is testing your code important, and when should you do it?  
- What are some simple methods you can use to verify that your program works as intended?

### Comments and Code Clarity
- Why are comments useful, and how much should you rely on them?  
- How would you write code in a way that’s easy for others to understand?

### Modularity and Reusability
- Why is it better to break your code into smaller, reusable functions or modules?  
- Describe a scenario where modularizing your code saved time or effort.

---

## Problem-Solving and Algorithms

### Algorithmic Thinking
- How do you break down a complex task into smaller steps before coding?  
- Describe the approach you’d take to solve a basic problem (e.g., finding the largest number in a list).

### Efficiency Considerations
- Why might efficiency matter, even at an introductory level?  
- Give an example of a simple improvement that could make your program run faster.

### Incremental Development
- Why is it beneficial to write and test small pieces of your program before adding more complexity?  
- Give an example of building a solution step by step.

## Final Project-Specific Questions

### File I/O and Persistence
- Why is it important to store data persistently instead of only in memory?
- How would you read a file line by line in Python? Walk me through the process.
- How would you ensure your program gracefully handles cases where a file doesn’t exist?

### Data Processing and Validation
- How would you approach filtering a dataset by a user-defined criterion in Python?
- Why is data validation important, and how would you implement it in a program (e.g., ensuring numeric input for age)?
- Explain how sorting works and describe how you would implement it programmatically.

### Visualization (For Data Science Option)
- Why is data visualization an important part of data analysis?
- How would you use a Python library like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to create a bar chart or scatter plot?
- What steps would you take to ensure your visualizations are clear and accessible to an audience?

### Algorithms and Simulation (For Computer Science Option)
- What is an algorithm, and why is it central to programming?
- How would you explain Breadth-First Search (BFS) to someone unfamiliar with graph traversal?
- Why is modularity important when simulating real-world scenarios like traffic lights or pathfinding?

### Security Practices (For Cybersecurity Option)
- What are some common risks of storing passwords in plaintext?
- Explain the concept of hashing and why it’s important for securing passwords.
- How would you implement basic error handling to prevent your program from crashing due to invalid user inputs?

### Documentation and Reflection
- Why is a README file important for a programming project?
- What should be included in a README file to ensure someone else can run and understand your project?
- How does your final project demonstrate your understanding of core programming concepts?

## Personal Reflection and Learning

### Reflection and Learning Outcomes
- How has learning to program changed how you approach problems, even outside of coding?
- What’s the most challenging concept you’ve encountered so far, and how did you work through it?
- How did working on the final project change how you think about programming?
