## **Presentation Guidelines**
Each team will have **10 minutes** to present their project to the class. Use the time wisely to showcase your work, explain its functionality, and share insights from the development process.

### **Structure of the Presentation**

- **Team Members**:
  - Introduce your team members and their roles (e.g., Team Lead, Lead Developer, Tester).
- **Project Overview**:
  - Briefly describe your project theme (Text-Based Game, Utility Tool, or Data Explorer).
  - State the problem your project solves and the purpose of your program.

#### **2. Demo of Core Functionality (4-5 minutes)**
- **Showcase Key Features**:
  - Run your program and demonstrate its main functionality.
  - Highlight core features implemented and how they solve the problem.
- **Explain the Code**:
  - Walk through a few critical sections of your code (e.g., a function or algorithm).
  - Keep it high-level and focus on important concepts rather than every detail.

#### **3. Reflections (2-3 minutes)**
- **Challenges and Solutions**:
  - Discuss any significant challenges your team faced during the project.
  - Explain how you overcame these challenges.
- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Share key takeaways from the project (e.g., technical skills, teamwork insights).
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Briefly describe how you would enhance the project if given more time.

#### **4. Questions and Feedback (1-2 minutes)**
- **Q&A Session**:
  - Invite your classmates and instructor to ask questions about your project.
- **Feedback**:
  - Ask for constructive feedback on what your team did well and where you could improve.
