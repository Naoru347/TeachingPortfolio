# **Lab 10: Midterm Project Presentations**

---

## **Objectives**
1. Demonstrate your midterm project and explain its purpose and functionality.
2. Reflect on the development process, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
3. Practice presenting technical work effectively to an audience.
4. Provide constructive feedback to your peers.

---

## **Presentation Guidelines**
Each team will have **10 minutes** to present their project to the class. Use the time wisely to showcase your work, explain its functionality, and share insights from the development process.

### **Structure of the Presentation**

#### **1. Introduction (1-2 minutes)**
- **Team Members**:
  - Introduce your team members and their roles (e.g., Team Lead, Lead Developer, Tester).
- **Project Overview**:
  - Briefly describe your project theme (Text-Based Game, Utility Tool, or Data Explorer).
  - State the problem your project solves and the purpose of your program.

#### **2. Demo of Core Functionality (4-5 minutes)**
- **Showcase Key Features**:
  - Run your program and demonstrate its main functionality.
  - Highlight core features implemented and how they solve the problem.
- **Explain the Code**:
  - Walk through a few critical sections of your code (e.g., a function or algorithm).
  - Keep it high-level and focus on important concepts rather than every detail.

### **Advice for Talking About Code**

For many of you, this may be the first time explaining code to an audience. Here are some tips to help you succeed:

1. **Start with the Big Picture**:
   - Briefly explain the purpose of the code section before diving into specifics.
   - Example: "This function calculates the average of a list of numbers. It's a core part of our data analysis feature."

2. **Focus on Key Concepts**:
   - Highlight the logic behind the code (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions) rather than reading it line-by-line.
   - Example: "We used a for loop here to iterate through the list and add each value to a running total."

3. **Use Visuals or Analogies**:
   - If possible, use a diagram or analogy to make the code more relatable.
   - Example: "Think of this dictionary as a filing cabinet where each key is a label and the value is the information inside."

4. **Simplify Technical Jargon**:
   - Avoid overly complex terms when a simpler explanation will do.
   - Example: Instead of "asynchronous API call," say "a background task that fetches data while the program runs."

5. **Engage Your Audience**:
   - Pause occasionally to ask if your explanation makes sense.
   - Invite questions during or after the presentation.

6. **Be Honest About Challenges**:
   - It's okay to say, "This part of the code was challenging, and here's how we approached it."

#### **3. Reflections (2-3 minutes)**
- **Challenges and Solutions**:
  - Discuss any significant challenges your team faced during the project.
  - Explain how you overcame these challenges.
- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Share key takeaways from the project (e.g., technical skills, teamwork insights).
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Briefly describe how you would enhance the project if given more time.

#### **4. Questions and Feedback (1-2 minutes)**
- **Q&A Session**:
  - Invite your classmates and instructor to ask questions about your project.
- **Feedback**:
  - Ask for constructive feedback on what your team did well and where you could improve.

## **Expectations for Audience Members**
1. **Be Engaged**:
   - Pay attention to each presentation and take notes.
2. **Ask Questions**:
   - Prepare at least one question for each team to help them reflect on their work.
3. **Provide Feedback**:
   - Be constructive and supportive when offering feedback.

## **Submission Instructions**
1. Submit your presentation slides (if used) and the final version of your codebase to the course LMS before class.
2. Ensure your GitHub repository is up-to-date and includes:
   - The final code.
   - A polished README file.
   - Documentation of team contributions.

## **Hints and Tips**
1. **Practice Your Presentation**:
   - Rehearse as a team to ensure you stay within the time limit.
   - Assign speaking roles for each section.
2. **Focus on Highlights**:
   - Prioritize demonstrating key features and significant parts of your code.
   - Avoid diving too deep into technical details unless asked during Q&A.
3. **Be Honest**:
   - Share genuine challenges and lessons learned. These are valuable for everyone.
4. **Prepare for Questions**:
   - Anticipate potential questions from classmates or the instructor.
   - Be ready to explain your thought process and decisions.
