# **Lab 3: Decision Making Programs**

---

## **Objectives**
1. Use conditional statements to handle decision-making in Python.
2. Develop simple interactive programs with meaningful user feedback.

## **Instructions**

### **Passing the Class**
Write a program that:  
- Prompts the user to enter their current percentage score in the class as an integer (e.g., an 85.4% is 85).
    - Remember:
        - 85.4 or .854 are floats
        - 85 or 86 are ints (integers)
- Checks if the user is going to pass the class (70 or higher).  
  - If they are eligible, print: `"You are probably going to pass the class."`  
  - If they are not eligible, print: `"You are probably not going to pass the class."`  

### **Even or Odd Check**
Extend the program to:  
- Prompt the user for a number.  
- Check if the number is even or odd.  
  - Print `"The number is even."` for even numbers.  
  - Print `"The number is odd."` for odd numbers.  

### **Using `if…elif…else` Chains**
- Structure your conditions clearly to handle all cases for both tasks.  
- Avoid redundant conditions where possible to streamline your code.  

### **Error Handling**
- While it's optional for this lab, consider how you might handle invalid inputs (e.g., letters instead of numbers).  

### **Code Style and Documentation**
- Add at least three meaningful comments to your code (e.g., explaining a decision or a tricky line).  
- Ensure your code is readable, with proper indentation and spacing.  

### **Submission**
- Save your completed program as `lab_3.py`.  
- Push your script to GitHub Classroom under the `Lab3` folder in your repository.

## **Hints**
- Think about how you can reuse `if` and `else` statements in multiple parts of the program.  
- Remember to test your program with different input values to ensure it behaves as expected for all cases.  

---

## **Stretch Challenge (Optional)**
If you finish early, extend your program to allow the user to:  
- Run the even/odd check for multiple numbers by entering `Y` or `N` after each check.  
- Add an extra decision-making feature of your choice (e.g., determining if the number is positive, negative, or zero).

## **Lab Report Reminder**
Don’t forget to write up your 1-2 page lab report using the provided template. Include reflections on how this skill could be applied to the **Midterm** or **Final Project**.
