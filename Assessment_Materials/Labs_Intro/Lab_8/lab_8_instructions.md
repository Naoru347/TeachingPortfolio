# **Lab 8: Midterm Project Kickoff and Team Collaboration**

---

## **Objectives**
1. Form project teams and establish clear team roles.
2. Collaboratively brainstorm and outline a project plan.
3. Practice pseudocode problem-solving as a team.
4. Create a timeline and establish team workflows for successful collaboration.

---

## **Scenario**
Your midterm project requires teamwork to build an **Interactive Console Application** that demonstrates your programming skills. In this lab, youâ€™ll focus on getting organized, setting goals, and practicing collaboration to ensure a smooth project workflow.

## **Instructions**

### **Part 1: Team Formation and Role Assignment** (15 minutes)
1. **Form Teams**:
   - Teams of 3-4 students.
   - Introduce yourselves and share strengths (e.g., coding, debugging, documentation, creativity).

2. **Assign Roles**:
   - **Team Lead**: Oversees the project timeline and ensures deadlines are met.
   - **Lead Developer**: Focuses on coding the core functionality.
   - **Tester/Debugger**: Tests the program and ensures it runs smoothly.
   - **Documentarian**: Writes the README and other documentation.

3. **Document Team Information**:
   - Create a shared document (e.g., Google Docs or a text file).
   - Record team member names, roles, and contact information.

---

### **Part 2: Project Planning and Brainstorming** (25 minutes)
1. **Select a Project Theme**:
   - **Text-Based Game**: An interactive story or game with branching decisions.
   - **Utility Tool**: A practical application for problem-solving (e.g., to-do list, calculator).
   - **Data Explorer**: A program for analyzing and summarizing simple datasets.

2. **Brainstorm Features**:
   - Use a shared document to list potential features for your chosen project.
   - Identify core features (must-have) and enhancements (nice-to-have).

3. **Outline a Project Plan**:
   - Write pseudocode for the core functionality.
   - Sketch the program flow (e.g., input/output interactions, loops, and decision-making).

4. **Create a Timeline**:
   - Use the project timeline from the assignment prompt to set weekly goals.
   - Break the project into tasks and assign responsibilities for each.

---

### **Part 3: Pseudocode Coding Challenge** (20 minutes)
1. **Scenario-Based Problem**:
   - Choose a small problem related to your project theme and write pseudocode as a team.
   
   **Examples:**
   - *Text-Based Game*: Write pseudocode for a branching decision tree where the player chooses between two paths.
   - *Utility Tool*: Write pseudocode for adding, removing, and displaying items in a to-do list.
   - *Data Explorer*: Write pseudocode for calculating the average of a list of numbers.

2. **Collaborative Effort**:
   - Use Python-like syntax for your pseudocode.
   - Discuss and refine your approach as a team.
   - Document your final pseudocode in your shared document.

---

### **Part 4: Presentation and Workflow Setup** (15 minutes)
1. **Mini-Presentation**:
   - Prepare a 2-minute mini-pitch for your project idea.
   - Include:
     - The problem your project solves.
     - Core features you plan to implement.
     - Team roles and collaboration strategies.

2. **Establish Team Workflow**:
   - Decide on tools for collaboration (e.g., GitHub, Google Docs, Slack).
   - Create a shared GitHub repository:
     - Add all team members as collaborators.
     - Set up a basic project directory structure:
       ```
       /src/
       /docs/
       README.md
       ```
     - Make an initial commit with a README file listing team members and project goals.

3. **Submit Your Work**:
   - Submit your shared document with team roles, project plan, pseudocode, and timeline to the course LMS.
   - Include a link to your GitHub repository.

---

## **Submission Instructions**
1. Submit the following by the end of lab:
   - Team shared document (team roles, project plan, pseudocode, timeline).
   - Link to your GitHub repository with an initial README file.
2. Ensure all team members are listed as collaborators on the repository.

## **Hints and Tips**
1. **For Brainstorming:**
   - Focus on realistic goals given the timeline.
   - Keep your core functionality simple and add enhancements later.

2. **For Pseudocode:**
   - Use clear, structured logic (e.g., indentations, step-by-step instructions).
   - Example pseudocode for a branching decision:
     ```python
     print("You are standing at a fork in the road.")
     choice = input("Do you go left or right? ")
     if choice == "left":
         print("You encounter a friendly dragon.")
     elif choice == "right":
         print("You fall into a trap. Game over.")
     else:
         print("Invalid choice. Try again.")
     ```

3. **For GitHub Workflow:**
   - Use meaningful commit messages (e.g., "Added pseudocode for branching decisions").
   - Assign tasks to avoid merge conflicts (e.g., work on different files or branches).
