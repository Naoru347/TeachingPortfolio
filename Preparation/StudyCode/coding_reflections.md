## General Reflections
Specific to teaching Python is the question of when/how to address PEP standards with students. Is this something to address directly and througout the teaching? Or, is this best done implicitly instead so that students focus more on implementation?

## Coding-specific Reflections

### Modular Thinking
- **Challenge**: Understanding why the program is organized into a function (`temperature_converter()`).
  - **Why It’s Hard**: Students new to programming may struggle to see why code reusability and organization matter.
  - **Solution**: Compare a script without functions to one with functions, highlighting the benefits of modular design.

### Edge Cases
- **Challenge**: Anticipating and handling edge cases like missing units (e.g., `100`) or unsupported formats (e.g., `abcF`).
  - **Why It’s Hard**: Beginners often focus on the "happy path" and don’t think about invalid or unusual inputs.
  - **Solution**: Discuss the importance of testing and demonstrate how to handle unexpected inputs.

### Overall Conceptual Understanding
- **Challenge**: Understanding how the individual pieces (input, processing, output) work together in the program.
  - **Why It’s Hard**: Seeing the program as a cohesive whole requires practice in breaking down and assembling components.
  - **Solution**: Walk through the code step by step with example inputs, showing how data flows and transforms.


## Python-specific Reflections

### Input Parsing and Validation
- **Challenge**: Understanding how to extract the numeric value and unit from a string like `100F`.
  - **Why It’s Hard**: It involves slicing strings, understanding string methods like `.strip()` and `.upper()`, and checking conditions.
  - **Solution**: Break down the input processing into clear, commented steps and explain each method’s purpose.

### Conditional Logic
- **Challenge**: Writing and organizing `if`/`elif`/`else` statements to handle valid and invalid units.
  - **Why It’s Hard**: Beginners often struggle with the flow of control or forget to handle edge cases like unsupported units.
  - **Solution**: Use a flowchart or pseudocode to demonstrate the decision-making process.

### String Manipulation
- **Challenge**: Using `temp_input[:-1]` to get the numeric part of the input and `temp_input[-1]` to get the unit.
  - **Why It’s Hard**: Beginners may not fully grasp Python’s string indexing and slicing.
  - **Solution**: Provide hands-on exercises focused on string slicing before introducing it in the program.

### Error Handling
- **Challenge**: Writing validation checks (e.g., ensuring input is numeric and the unit is valid).
  - **Why It’s Hard**: They may not know how to structure checks or use methods like `.isdigit()` and `.replace()`.
  - **Solution**: Explain why validation is important and give simpler examples of input validation (e.g., checking for integers first).

### Formatting Output
- **Challenge**: Using `f"{value:.1f}"` to format numbers to one decimal place.
  - **Why It’s Hard**: Students may not understand string interpolation or formatting syntax.
  - **Solution**: Provide examples of formatted strings and practice exercises to build familiarity.
